gazetter, business directory, who's who : nouns in the collective mind
an object exists in the collective mind and in individual minds
during sleep the individual mind is uploaded to the collective mind and vice-versa

relationship of noun in collective mind to same noun in individual mind
relationship of noun in one thot to sam noun in another thot

noun pulled into a thot
only one copy of person and bank
a thought contains copy or virtual copy or link to that object

python
x = obj, x is a reference to obj
number of open questions on each noun => urgency or interest
thoughts can ramble from one noun to a referenced noun, depending on interest/urgency, and also on focus trait
if a person has a high focus, he is less likely to move to a referenced thot, even as the urgency of the referenced thot is higher
thot vs noun: thot has verbs and connections and syllogisms
connectors: verbs, prepositions
thot vs sentence: thot can have multiple clauses

if the sky is clear, the air is hot
when the sky is clear, the air is hot

sky clear => air hot  : the thought becomes the connetion between the two nouns

when birds fly south  =>  winter will come soon  : connection between two sentences


birds
fly
birds fly (skill)
birds migrate south in winter
birds migrate north in spring
when you see birds flying south, you can guess winter is coming

when the hammer comes down, the nail is driven into the wood
you can drive the nail into the wood by bringing the hammer down onto the nail

linking
	verb
	is
	syllogism 

can you draw a thought as a diagram of things and links?







temporarily switch subject, maybe for only one question
	option, every question, choose subj or any other noun in the structure as subj of next question
	potentially nested subj switches

s you go where, s v adv?  a tree of adverbs off the verb
an adverb can have prep and object
the object is a noun and it can have adj phrases off it
going to the bank on the corner on Tanon Nimman

John
    go
        to the bank
	    in the mall
        to get money
            to pay for school
	now (timestamp)  future:plan, past:fact
	with my friend
	walk

John, bank, mall, money, school, friend, 
all possible subjects for future questions
"probing questions", repeating the question with a new subject
where is the bank, is still asking about the verb go, repeating the question, but switching the subject
why do you go to the bank -> why do you get money -> why do you pay for school
which school, where is the school
which business (of type) - open ended, could respond with name, location, description 

clarify question about object of the preposition, to the bank
	which bank
	where is the bank (it)?  near my house, in the mall
	you like this bank?  yes
	why you like this bank?  good mobile app

have you done this before?
when was the last time you went here?

data structure to express conversational patterns

to any question, multiple answers
to any answer, multiple followup questions
following any answer, a flip back

conversational patterns (as opposed to sentence syntax)

story segment
	really?  interjection response expected
yes really       ack
	wow      interjection stop 
story segment    coninuation


q1
   a1
q2    - followup question
   a2
q3    - followup to a1 or a2, how to assign priority?
   a3
   q4 - flip back, when to flip back?
a4
   q5
a5
s6    - story
   k6 - acknowledgement interjection

conversation mode
	handshake protocols: hello
	q&a - information gathering
	story - entertainment or communication, narrative, lecture, explanation, persuasion
	interjection protocols

	story or lecture first, then q&a
	stories and q&a interspersed
	disegagement protocols: goodbye

	handshake protocol can begin a q&a session

	remark - may require ack or not, may invite question
	remark - a story is a sequence of remarks
	remark, story, ack, interjection (q or stop), question, answer

conversation among equals
	balanced
	questions, answers, stories, interjections, word count, all equal
	purpose is to share information and understanding

dominance
	teacher
		lecture
		student only asking questions, mostly listening
	drill
		coach questions repeatedly
	team leader
		leader
			tells story to explain mission
			issues specific commands
			answers questions
		followers ask questions to clarify orders
		
	dressing down
		boss criticizing and commanding subordinate
			subordinate only makes submissive acks: yes sir
	lawyer making a case
		lawyer tells story
		one-way q&a, leading questions
	bully demanding submission
		i'm right, you're wrong
		to criticize, prove wrong, belittle, "destroy"


for now, focus on balanced conversation

cannot
	make long dialogs

must
	use pairs: q/a, statement/response
	but often the second of the pair is a list of potential responses
	the dialog unfolds line by line

q&a
hello protocol
goodbye protocol
story

pattern matching
	incoming question: match to a question in the grammar
	incoming answer: match to one of the expected responses of the preceding question
	proceed like a billiards game, looking three moves ahea
	looking three steps back

1. match to expected response to previous statement/question
2. match to all statements questions in the grammar

matching algorithm
	identify subject, verb, object, adv, adj (multiple possibilities)
	currently not storing pos in grammar
 
instead of attaching optional {polite} to each sentence, develop an algorithm for when to add
	strip it off before matching

complex sentence structures
syllogism

-----------------
data structures, db tables, related to dict

	gazetteer: country, province, city, village, road, street
	business directory
	proper names: first, last, nick
	who's who - famous persons

in vocab, add "desired" words, like local gazetteer, local business listings
	let user choose from menu and also add new ones
	vocab = uservocab

during sleep
	move day's conversations to memory
	memory structions: 
		events
		descriptions, characteristics
	
conversation is driven by the need to gather information about the world
