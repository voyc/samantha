Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, in proportions which can be varied to achieve varying mechanical and electrical properties.[1] It is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure.

Bronze is an alloy also containing copper, but instead of zinc it has tin;[2] both bronze and brass may include small proportions of a range of other elements including arsenic, lead, phosphorus, aluminum, manganese, and silicon. The distinction between the two alloys is largely historical,[3] and modern practice in museums and archaeology increasingly avoids both terms for historical objects in favour of the all-embracing "copper alloy".[4]
