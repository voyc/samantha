===== glossary =====
**teletype** - Historically sometime between the telegraph and the fax came the teletype machine.  A teletype machine was a printer combined with an electric typewriter keyboard.  These devices allowed for electric long-distance text communications.

**tty** - an abbreviation for teletype.

**console** - The teletype machine happened to be a convenient way for a human to communicate with a computer.  The printer was eventually replaced by an electronic CRT display or monitor.  But the monitor still looked just like a printer, with scrolling lines of user input and program output.

**terminal** -  When multi-user capabilities came about, the operator continued to use the console, and the additional users were each given a terminal.  The console and the terminals were nearly identical, though perhaps you could identify some differences:
  * One console was hard-wired into the computer and was activated during the boot process.  
  * Multiple terminals are plugged in via serial cables and come alive when a user logs in.

**GUI** - The graphical user interface was designed at Xerox PARC and found its way to market in Steve Job’s Macintosh .  Mouse, keyboard, monitor.  Desktop metaphor with icons for folders, documents, printers and trash cans.  Drag and drop.

**terminal emulator** - For many, the GUI is just a fancy covering on the terminal.  If you want to do real work, you’ll do it in a terminal window running in the GUI.

**Terminal Multiplexer** - There are two popular terminal multiplexers: tmux and screen.  Both of these programs allow the user to do two things:
  - Manage multiple terminal sessions in one window without a GUI.
  - Run terminal sessions in the background, so you can detach and re-attach.
