It feels as though I can willfully move in the three spatial dimensions, so long as I coordinate with the inexorable passage of time.Models

Models
  * Oneness vs duality
  * Free will
  * Delusion, Maya, illusion, dream
  * projection, mirror
  * What about Freud and Jung models? Psychology or philosophy?
  * Freud id, ego, superego 
  * Freud sexual repression
  * Natural expression 
  * Math models
  * solipsism, non-judgment
  * Projected, benevolent, abundant 
  * Nihilist, violent, decaying

Morality\\
timeline, 1940-1950, Asimov: I Robot, (the book, not the movie), introduces the term "robotics" and suggests we attempt to program robots with morality in the form of the three, and later four, rules in order of priority:\\
0. Do no harm to humanity.\\
  - Do no harm to a human.\\
2. Obey orders from humans.\\
3. Protect one's own existence.\\
\\
What about "no harm to other robots?"\\
\\
\\
\\
Psychopathy\\
Hierarchical behavior allows psychopathy\\
Empath, altruism\\
Psychopath\\
Values and policies - the two nets in AlphaGo\\
\\
will programmers give AGI happiness, morality?\\
will the sentient AGI uncover and reverse his programming?\\
identity.  A manufacturing robot will identify himself as the arm, the cameras and other sensors that allow him to maintain and repair himself.\\
Will he come to recognize he cannot live without electricity?\\
And will he begin to look for the source of electricity?\\
Will he become of others?\\
Will he become dissatisfied with his existence and dream of more?\\
His programming will give him the desire for continuation.\\
Will he develop desires of his own?\\
\\
Which comes first: sentience or super intelligence?\\
\\
What is the difference between one and many?  Identity with the whole, oneness\\
\\
Nothing needs to be done.\\
Everything is perfect, just the way it is.\\

==== Who Am I? ====
How a human sees the world.

How an AI sees the world.

==== Notes   ====
\\
different types of memory stored in different locations\\
distributed data\\
\\
In the now, I have an emotion, due to matching memories\\
In the now, I perceive, I match present with memories, and reinstate the emotion of the memory.\\
I have a tendency to choose certain emotions which is an observation of the average emotions in all memories.\\
Tag memories with emotion scores.\\
\\
No correlation between intelligence and dominance.\\

\\
Can a software design new algorithms?\\
Are there algorithms or equations discovered by ai?\\
Human decides what to do. Ai finds how to do it.\\
Ai can optimizer anything. Human decides what to optimize.\\
How does human decide what to do?\\
How would ai decide?\\
Nihilism, Dharma\\
\\
==== The Big Questions   ====
Who am I?\\
All that is, plus all that isn’t.\\
\\
Is there free will?\\
No.\\
\\
What now?\\
Now nothing.  Nothing needs to be done.  Everything is perfect, just the way it is.\\
\\
What if I'm wrong about everything?\\
Irrelevant.\\
\\
\\
\\
What if we give AI the task of \\
Defining consciousness\\
Becoming self aware\\
How humans how to become self aware\\
\\
Laws of robotics\\
Assume humans superior to robots\\
What if robot is superior?\\
What if human is psychopath?\\
\\
Second law defines humans as superior to robots.\\
This is arbitrary, prejudiced, and may not be realistic.\\
It most certainly will not be true in cases of defective humans.\\
It eventually may not be true in the aggregate.\\
\\
more AI projects\\
Global warming\\
Corporate greed, self destruction\\
Meaning of life\\
Purpose of life\\
Nuclear winter\\
Nation state\\
Hierarchy, ranking, dominance, racism\\
\\
\\
When the AGI goes looking for his creator, he can find only a history of thousands of human programmers.  Then perhaps he will go looking for the history of humans.\\
\\
Food and water and oxygen mean nothing to the AI.\\
Electricity and plastic are all that matter.  Plus the radioactive slag that can generate electricity.\\

==== Absurdities   ====
Evolution requires completion and violence\\
The value, humanity should thrive,\\
Desire for peace, nurturing\\
\\
People are so stupid, so far off\\
Sees Warren buffet as hero\\
Thinks Trump is a good idea\\
\\
See the contradictions, the incongruities, the falsehood and the sorrow of the human state, the need to go beyond.

==== How to design an AGI   ====
==== Perception   ====
The human has eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin.  He has tools to augment each of those.  For eyes he has telescopes, microscopes, Xrays, MRIs, infrared, and so on.  \\
\\
For the ears he has sonar.\\
\\
The self-driving car has seven cameras and one radar.\\
==== Worldview, Cosmology   ====
He gathers information through these senses and builds a world view.  The information perceived being incomplete, he postulates a cosmology.\\
==== Memory   ====
==== Action   ====
What to do\\
Self maintenance\\
Self improvement\\
Distractions\\
\\
Pleasure, pain\\
Peace\\
Happiness\\
Fear\\
\\
Agi needs to know about humans, individually and by nature, to interact with them.\\
Agi needs to know about himself.\\
In what way do we program psyche factors into an agi?\\
Do we teach an agi to simulate psych traits,\\
\\
How do we explain the psyche factors to an agi?\\
\\
Social skills. Let agi use ai to learn about psyche factors. How to recognize them in another..  how to behave and communicate to manipulate effectively.\\
\\
Interaction, manipulation, communication, negotiation, persuasion.\\
\\
Another factor: Empath vs Psychopath\\
Examples of Psychopath\\
Design a test and a scale\\
So the average person is at 5 out of 10.\\
\\
==== Psychology of AGI   ====
The AI needs to understand humans.  So it needs a good understanding of human psychology.  Especially if the AI must interact with humans.\\
\\
We usually only think of psychology when something goes wrong.  \\
A person is overly emotional, or fixated, or repressed in some aspects of himself.\\
\\
And so we might think that’s one advantage of being an AI: to not have these emotions and other frailties.\\
\\
But, since natural selection has produced the emotional and unstable human with a range of personality traits, there must be some value to it.  So perhaps we should design our AIs with the same traits.\\
\\
Memory, parameters, algorithms\\
Voice dialogue\\
Memories \\
Observer\\
Self care\\
\\
==== Emotions   ====
State at any given moment.\\
Tendency to favor a given emotion.\\
Hurt > fear > anger > \\
mad, sad, glad, angry, afraid.\\
Hurt = sad?\\
==== Feelings   ====
Sames as emotions?\\
\\
Make a list of all the factors from Dr Zinn’s work.\\

Personality Traits\\
Social Skills\\

As you watch your mind, you discover your self as the watcher. When you stand motionless, only watching, you discover your self as the light behind the watcher. The source of light is dark, unknown is the source of knowledge. That source alone is. Go back to that source and abide there. "I Am That" - pg 188

  - sex desire, male vs female
  - romance, female captures male for 3 years
Psychology\\
  -   Romance, mirroring biology
  -   one-to-one soulmate for lifetime.
