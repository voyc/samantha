timeline, 1940-1950, Asimov: I Robot, (the book, not the movie), introduces the term "robotics" and suggests we attempt to program robots with morality in the form of the three, and later four, rules in order of priority:\\
0. Do no harm to humanity.\\
  - Do no harm to a human.\\
2. Obey orders from humans.\\
3. Protect one's own existence.\\

==== How to design an AGI   ====
==== Perception   ====
The human has eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin.  He has tools to augment each of those.  For eyes he has telescopes, microscopes, Xrays, MRIs, infrared, and so on.  \\
\\
For the ears he has sonar.\\
\\
The self-driving car has seven cameras and one radar.\\
==== Worldview, Cosmology   ====
He gathers information through these senses and builds a world view.  The information perceived being incomplete, he postulates a cosmology.\\

In what way do we program psyche factors into an agi?\\
Do we teach an agi to simulate psych traits,\\
\\
How do we explain the psyche factors to an agi?\\
\\
Social skills. Let agi use ai to learn about psyche factors. How to recognize them in another..  how to behave and communicate to manipulate effectively.\\
\\
Interaction, manipulation, communication, negotiation, persuasion.\\

\\
==== Psychology of AGI   ====
The AI needs to understand humans.  So it needs a good understanding of human psychology.  Especially if the AI must interact with humans.\\
\\
We usually only think of psychology when something goes wrong.  \\
A person is overly emotional, or fixated, or repressed in some aspects of himself.\\
\\
And so we might think that’s one advantage of being an AI: to not have these emotions and other frailties.\\
\\
But, since natural selection has produced the emotional and unstable human with a range of personality traits, there must be some value to it.  So perhaps we should design our AIs with the same traits.\\

As you watch your mind, you discover your self as the watcher. When you stand motionless, only watching, you discover your self as the light behind the watcher. The source of light is dark, unknown is the source of knowledge. That source alone is. Go back to that source and abide there. "I Am That" - pg 188

==== Solipsism ====
Solipsism is the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external ... Wikipedia


==== Nihilism ====

Usually considered bad.  But that is judgmental.

==Nihilism and stillness==
Some people are not comfortable with stillness like a boat rocking in the waves with no wind, like nihilism.

Stillness is balance centeredness stability independence.


==== Identity ====

You need not know what you are. Enough to know what you are not. What you are you will never know, for every discovery reveals new dimensions to conquer. The unknown has no limits.

Watch your mind, how it comes into being, how it operates. As you watch your mind, you discover your self as the watcher. When you stand motionless, only watching, you discover your self as the light behind the watcher.

==== Philosophy of mind ====
Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the ontology and nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. The mind–body problem is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind, although other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness, and the nature of particular mental states.[2][3][4] Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, the ontology of the mind, the nature of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.

Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly. Dualism finds its entry into Western philosophy thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century.[5] Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.[6]

Monism is the position that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BCE and was later espoused by the 17th-century rationalist Baruch Spinoza.[7] Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism),[8][9][10][11][12][13] and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear.[12][14][15] Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world can be thought of as either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to the position that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.[16]

Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive physicalist or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.[16] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of sociobiology, computer science (specifically, artificial intelligence), evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences.[17][18][19][20] Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.[21][22][23] Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance, mental properties supervene on physical properties, or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.[24][25] Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues; however, they are far from being resolved. Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms.
