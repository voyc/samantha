== Hippocampus ==
Hippocampus looks like a seahorse.  Hippo is greek for horse, campo for eel.

Converts short-term memory into long-term memory.  If the hippocampus is damaged, new experiences fade away, but old memories remain intact.

== Memory Consolidation ==
Long-term memory is spread throughout the Cerebral Cortex.  When the Hippocampus experiences touching something hot, it replays that experience repeatedly into the Crebral Cortex until it becomes a long-term memory.

Learning is behavior modification based on new experiences.  The Hippocampus "teaches" the Cerebral Cortex new memories which will modify future behavior.
