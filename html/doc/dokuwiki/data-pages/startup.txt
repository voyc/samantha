====== Startup ======

System configuration

Service bootstrap

Historically, the startup system has recently moved from init to [[systemd]].

Ten years ago, most distributions used SysV Init.
Various distributions developed new and improved init systems.  Ubuntu built Upstart, for example.
As of 2020, most distributions have switched to systemd, developed at Red Hat.
It was a long and controversial adoption period, and still today Ubuntu version 20 supports both init and systemd.  So one can find remnants of SysVInit still present, though systemd-init is the primary startup system.

For example, the following are from SysV init:
  $ service --status-all  # list the startup services
  $ ls /etc/init.d  # list the scripts to start and manage the services

These have been replaced by systemd
  $ systemctl
  $ ls /lib/systemd/system


So let's look at the cron service.
For every script in /etc/init.d, there is a unit file in /lib/systemd/system.


  * /etc/init.d/cron -> /lib/systemd/system

With SysV Init you could run the init.d script directly:
  $ exec /etc/init.d/cron -options

or you could use the service command.
  $ service cron start

Now in systemd, you use the systemctl command.
  $ systemctl cron start

Configuration files:
/etc/default/name
/etc/name/name.conf

====== from init to systemd ======

init - the original from SystemV Unix, serial-processing, slow boots

upstart - ubuntu-developed more efficient init

openrc - dependency-based, combines aspects of init and systemd

runit - cross-platform: BSD, MacOS, etc

systemd - multi-processing for fast boot, now ubiquitous

note: gentoo has its own init system

As of 2020, init has been replaced by systemd.  See below.
