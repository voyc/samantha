====== Startup ======

Historically, the startup system has recently moved from init to systemd.

Ten years ago, most distributions used SysV Init.
Various distributions developed new and improved init systems.  Ubuntu built Upstart, for example.
As of 2020, most distributions have switched to systemd, developed at Red Hat.
It was a long and controversial adoption period, and still today Ubuntu version 20 supports both init and systemd.  So one can find remnants of SysVInit still present, though systemd-init is the primary startup system.

For example, the following are from SysV init:
  $ service --status-all  # list the startup services
  $ ls /etc/init.d  # list the scripts to start and manage the services

These have been replaced by systemd
  $ systemctl
  $ ls /lib/systemd/system


So let's look at the cron service.
For every script in /etc/init.d, there is a unit file in /lib/systemd/system.


  * /etc/init.d/cron -> /lib/systemd/system

With SysV Init you could run the init.d script directly:
  $ exec /etc/init.d/cron -options

or you could use the service command.
  $ service cron start

Now in systemd, you use the systemctl command.
  $ systemctl cron start

Configuration files:
/etc/default/name
/etc/name/name.conf
