==== Human Sex ====
Humans have all of the mammalian sex attributes, plus these additions.\\
The female's ovulation is not broadcast.  Nobody knows consciously that she is in heat, not even the female herself.\\


==== Psychology of Sex ====
A number of taboos.\\
Shame for exercising the mammalian behaviors.\\
Marriage.\\
Romantic love surrounding the hormonal bonding.\\

The differences between male and female humans means very few humans are ever satsified.\\
Once a month during ovulation, the female has a desire for sex with strangers, after which she feels shame and guilt.\\
The male has desire for strange females all the time, which he attempts to sublimate with his wife, but finds she has no desire either.\\

Females have two types of desire.
1. A DNA-based desire for outsider semen, when she is ovulating.
2. A psychological need to enslave a male who will take care of her and her offspring.
