In the yoga sciences there is no such thing as brain. Brain is body.

Mind has 16 parts in four categories.

1. Buddhi.  Intellect.  Sharp, like a knife, used to cut things open. To dissect. A survival instrument.

Modern Western science is all intellect. You can cut open The material aspects of a flower and learn much about it but you cannot know the flower and you no longer have the flower.

[Ed. Like smashing the atom to learn subatomic physics.]

Requires memory, data.

Aside. in a traditional Indian School the children are not taught any academics. They are taught yoga, classical dance, classical music, Kalaripayattu (the mother of all martial arts), English, Sanskrit.



2. Ahankara.  Identity.

Race, religion, country, village, family.

The intellect will fight to protect whatever identity you have chosen. The identity enables the intellect to function.

Eight dimensions of memory.

15000 years ago, Adiyogi, the first Yogi, describe evolution. Fish, amphibian, mammal, half-mammal-half-man, dwarf-man, volatile man, peaceful man, loving man, meditative man, mystical man.

If your intellect is sharp, it is important that your identity be cosmic and your memory be evolved.

4. Chitta. Intelligence unsullied by memory. 

If you touch your chitta, God will become your slave.

It is boundless.
