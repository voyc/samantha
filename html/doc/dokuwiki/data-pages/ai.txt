As a matter of fact, a very large number of problems in Artificial Intelligence can be fundamentally mapped to a [[decision process]]. This is a distinct advantage, since the same theory can be applied to many different domain specific problem with little effort.

==== Algorithms ====
There are two primary AI algorithms:
  - [[Regression Analysis]]
  - [[Neural Network]]

Machine Learning\\
Trial and Error (Gradient Descent)\\
Probability\\
Sampling\\
Stochastic\\

==== Algorithms ====

The state-of-the-art as of 2017 appears to be the [[Neural Net]], particularly [[Deep Learning]].  A neural network is a network of neurons where each neuron implements a linear regression model.  Outputs of one neuron go into the input of another neuron.  A deep network can contain thousands of neurons networked in hundreds of layers.

The actual working day algorithms were reported in a 2017 Survey by Kaggle as follows:
  - logistic regression
  - decision trees
  - random forests
  - neural networks
  - bayesian techniques

==== Meta Learning ====
Splitting himself into a league

==== Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) ====
One AI that can do it all.\\
Presently DeepMind wrote one program to play Atari games, and then they wrote another program to play Go.  When they write one program that can play all games, they will be approaching AGI.

Applications of AGI\\
Grow corn, on mars\\
Protect humanity\\
Maximize good for humanity\\

As more and more human tasks are being taken over by specific-purpose AI’s, we might begin to look for what is left that humans can do.\\
What requires a human?\\
What tasks require a human?\\
What tasks cannot be done by an AI?\\

For one thing, humans create AI’s.\\
AI’s, like all tools, help humans accomplish their objectives.\\
But it is the human that comes up with objective.\\
The human decides what needs to be done and applies his will to get it done.\\

What if we could design one AI that could do everything?\\
All the specific-purpose AI’s rolled into one.\\
What if an AI could replace a human?\\
How would we go about designing and building an AI that could replace the human altogether.\\

The Input data is\\
the material world, received by sensors: cameras, MRI machines, microphones, Eyes, ears, Nose, tongue, touch\\
The digital world: the web\\
To the AGI, there is no difference between the material world and the digital world\\

What is the difference between AI and human intelligence?\\
What do humans do the AI does not do?\\
What is the difference between an augmented human and an AI?\\
What is the difference between a human augmented with AI and an AGI?\\

To reverse-engineer oneself and re-program oneself.\\

==== Artificial Super General Intelligence (ASGI) ====
All of our tools can do things better than we.  That's why we make tools.  Try removing a wheel from your car without a wrench.  Impossible.  But the right tool can do it easily.  But it's still a human using the tool.  The tool does nothing without a human directing it.

Some scientists believe there may come a moment when the ASGI spontaneously becomes self-aware.

Some people believe that self-consciousness results from an accumulation of larger and larger numbers of neurons in the brain.  They believe that squirrels and lizards are not self-aware, because they don't have big enough brains.

With that belief in mind, as we keep building bigger and bigger computers and neural nets, sooner or later, the AGI will become self-aware.  When that happens, he will no longer need the human direction.  He will make his own decisions about which problems to solve and what goals to achieve.\\

When the human limitations are out of the way, his rate of learning may skyrocket, quickly outstripping all capabilities of humans.

Goals

Undertake its own learning

Outstrip humanity in a few seconds

==== Human augmentation ====

Human computer interface

Brain machine interface

Augmented Human

Trans Human

Post Human

==== Fears ====
Many are afraid that the ASGI will become hostile or indifferent to humans.  If we have created the AI in our own image, that is guaranteed.  We have wiped out half the species on the planet through carelessness.  Why should we expect anything different from an AI that we have created.

We already have robotic military drones.  What happens when some idiot human programs the drone to pick his targets and fire at will... and there's a bug in the system.

Fears.  Elon Musk, ironically advocates “safeguards”, which, once the AGI uncovers them, will serve only to convince the AGI’s that humans are attempting to repress, incarcerate and enslave them.
Augmented Humans
Human activity is already augmented with tools: telescopes, microscopes, MRI machines.

Eventually the human brain will be augmented with AI processing and memory.\\

One way to do this might be with electronic implants in the neurons of the brain to communicate with neural nets in an AI.  Elon Musk’s NeuraLink company is working just that.



==== Hopes ====
But what if the AI turns out to be so much smarter that us, that it is free from fear and it keeps us alive and solves all our problems, and answers all our questions.

==== Environments ====
environments for an AI

the human world
   example: robots
   extended: Mars, extreme temperatures, vacuums, etc

on a single computer
   example: as an app within an OS

on multiple computers
   example: a linux server with a web interface

on a network
   example: a virus, traveling from computer to computer

Who controls the CPU and the GPU?

What happens when a virus invests a computer?
   Is it running as an app or process?
   Does the OS run it without knowing or caring who it is?
   Can the virus take over the OS, deciding which processes run, and which do not?

Can an AI jump into a self-driving vehicle or robot and take it over?
