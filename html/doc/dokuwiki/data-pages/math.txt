==== Timeline ====
  * 2000 BC, Babylon, algebra in use
  * 10th century BCE, in China, ancient texts describe the use of _arrays_ to solve simultaneous equations, including the concept of determinants.  
  * 6th century BCE, in Greece, Pythagoras...
  * 4th century BCE, in India, the Hindu numerals 1-9 and 0 are in use.
  * 3rd century BCE, in Greece, Euclid and Archimedes...
  * 300 BC, School of Athens, classical Greece, Euclid, Geometry, shapes, circles, triangles
  * 300 BC, Greece, diaphantus 
  * 5th century CE, in India, first use of decimal places.
  * 600 AD, India, Brahmagupta
  * 780-850 CE, in Bahgdad, the Hindu numerals spread to the Islamic world thanks to Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi, who also coins the word _al-jabr_, or in english, _algebra_.
  * 1250 CE, in Europe, the Hindu numerals and decimal system arrived in the works of al-Khwarizmi, brought back from the holy lands by the crusaders, replacing the Greek and Roman numeral systems.
  * 1545-1850 CE, in Europe and Japan, _array_ methods arrive from China, and the word _matrix_ is coined to replace the word _array_.
  * 1600 Decartes, 32 youngers than Galileo , Cartesian Coordinate System  connection between algebra and geometry
  * 1600 galileo
  * 1700 Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibnez, Euler, another guy, in Europe, invented calculus among other things.
  * Niels bohr, goes beyond Newton in subparticle and interplanetary physics.  
  * Hermann Minkowski 4d space time 1908

  * Pythagoras Euclid Archimedes  
  * Classical Hellenic Hellenistic  
  * Copernicus
