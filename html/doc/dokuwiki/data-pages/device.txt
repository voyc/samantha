====== Device ======
A device file is an interface to a device driver.  
A device file is sometimes called a special file or a device special file.
The device file allows a program to interact with the device using standard input/output system calls.

Two types of device file:
* character - serial stream of characters
* block - fixed size blocks, random access, buffered, example: disk

Most device files are managed as part of a virtual file system mounted at /dev.

Device file is pointer, not container.
