====== Neural Network ======

Neural Network (NN)
NN can be expressed as matrix math, or as circles and arrows
NN combination of yes/no decisions
Neuron reduces multiple stimulae to fire/no-fire output
Recurrent nn, output feeds back in, feedback
Feed-forward - not recurrent, no memory, no feedback
