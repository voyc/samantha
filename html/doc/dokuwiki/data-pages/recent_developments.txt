2017 Dec 22: Researchers with The State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, within the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have published details on the 'ParallelEye' dataset, a 3D urban environment modeled on Beijing's Zhongguancun region. They constructed the dataset by grabbing the available Open Street Map (OSM) layout data for a 2km*3km area, then modeled that data using CityEngine, and built the whole environment in the Unity3D engine.

2017 Oct 30:  "Deep learning-based [[memory systems]] are currently hard to train and of dubious utility.  One candidate memory system is the [[Neural Turing Machine]] ([[NTM]]), which was introduced by DeepMind in a research paper in 2014. NTMs can let networks - in certain, quite limited tasks - perform tasks with less training and higher accuracy than other systems. Successors, like the [[Neural GPU]], extended the capabilities of the NTM to work on harder tasks, like being able to multiply numbers. Then it was further extended with the [[Evolvable Neural Turing Machine]].  Now, researchers in Denmark have proposed the [[HyperENTM]], which uses evolution techniques to figure out how to wire together the memory interface, and connect to an [[external memory]] component."

2017 Oct 16: "One of the more popular tropes within AI research is that of the [[paperclip maximizer]] - the worry that if we build a super-intelligent AI and give it overly simple objectives (eg, make paper clips), it will seek to achieve those objectives to the detriment of everything else."  Here is webgame to do just that.

2017 Oct 16: "While most people are focusing on different [[evolutionary optimization]] algorithms when using [[deep learning]] (eg, [[REINFORCE]], [[HYPERNEAT]], [[NEAT]], and so on), [[Ant Colony Optimization]] ([[ACO]]) is an interesting side-channel: you get a bunch of [[agents]] - //ants_ - to go and explore the problem space and, much like their real world insect counterparts, lay down synthetic pheromones for their other ant chums to follow when they find something that approximates to _food//".
