A consortium of Chinese universities along with seventeen companies - including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and ByteDance - have developed AIBench, an AI benchmarking suite meant to compete with MLPerf, an AI benchmarking suite predominantly developed by American universities and companies.

Google researchers have trained a chatbot with uncannily good conversational skills. The bot, named Meena, is a 2.6 billion parameter language model trained on 341GB of text data, filtered from public domain social media conversations. Meena uses a seq2seq model (the same sort of technology that powers Google's "Smart Compose" feature in gmail), paired with an Evolved Transformer encoder and decoder - it's interesting to see something like this depend so much on a component developed via neural architecture search.

MuZero from DeepMind, combines all previous programs for Atari, Go, Chess, Space Invaders.  And it learns the games rules itself via reinforcement learning.  AlphaZero, the previously lauded Go champion, was fed the game rules to start.  MuZero gets equally good results, but was never fed the game rules; it learned the rules itself.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10201
More recently, we've seen a further push to make such so-called 'neural architecture search' (NAS) systems efficient, and approaches like ENAS (Import AI #82)  and SMASH (Import AI #56) have shown how to take systems that previously required hundreds of GPUs and fit them onto one or two GPUs.

2017 Dec 22: Researchers with The State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, within the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have published details on the 'ParallelEye' dataset, a 3D urban environment modeled on Beijing's Zhongguancun region. They constructed the dataset by grabbing the available Open Street Map (OSM) layout data for a 2km*3km area, then modeled that data using CityEngine, and built the whole environment in the Unity3D engine.

2017 Oct 30:  "Deep learning-based [[memory systems]] are currently hard to train and of dubious utility.  One candidate memory system is the [[Neural Turing Machine]] ([[NTM]]), which was introduced by DeepMind in a research paper in 2014. NTMs can let networks - in certain, quite limited tasks - perform tasks with less training and higher accuracy than other systems. Successors, like the [[Neural GPU]], extended the capabilities of the NTM to work on harder tasks, like being able to multiply numbers. Then it was further extended with the [[Evolvable Neural Turing Machine]].  Now, researchers in Denmark have proposed the [[HyperENTM]], which uses evolution techniques to figure out how to wire together the memory interface, and connect to an [[external memory]] component."

2017 Oct 16: "One of the more popular tropes within AI research is that of the [[paperclip maximizer]] - the worry that if we build a super-intelligent AI and give it overly simple objectives (eg, make paper clips), it will seek to achieve those objectives to the detriment of everything else."
