====Kernel====


The kernel kernel is stored in boot:
  * /boot/vmlinuz - kernel image
  * /boot/config - configuration
  * /boot/system.map - symbols table

The kernel modules are stored in /lib/modules:
  * /lib/modules/


====Directory Structure====

How are the linux components organized on disk? 

partitions
/
/usr
/home
swap


Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) \\ 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard

<code>
$ man hier # show complete tree of system folders
</code>

Directories: \\ 
/ - root of the tree \\ 
/bin - binary executable files \\ 
/boot - files used during boot \\ 
/dev - one file for each device, physical and virtual \\ 
/etc - configuration files \\ 
/tmp - temporary files, will be empty at next boot \\ 
/usr - duplicate of whole tree \\ 
/home - one folder for each user \\ 
/root - for the root user, not /home/root \\ 

Directories
  * / - root of the tree

Locations for binary executables and scripts.  \\ 
/bin   # in Ubuntu 20, soft link to /usr/bin \\ 
/sbin  # in Ubuntu 20, soft link to /usr/sbin \\ 
/usr/bin   #  \\ 
/usr/sbin  #  \\ 
/usr/local/bin  # put my own scripts here \\ 
/usr/local/sbin  # put my own root scripts here \\ 

sbin - s is for system, for commands that require root privileges
bin - root not required

According to the documentation, /bin and /sbin are for commands that are required before the /usr partition is mounted.  But in Ubuntu 20 on my RacerSwift, they are soft linked to /usr.

The first four - /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin - should be populated only by the package manager.  /usr/local/bin and sbin is for files not coming from the package manager.

Where do executables live?
Folder
Who populates
Who uses


/bin
package manager
any user


/sbin
package manager
root


/usr/bin
package manager
any user


/usr/sbin
package manager
root


/usr/local/bin
any user
any user


/usr/local/sbin
any user
root


/home/me/.local/bin
me
me



/bin vs /sbin - the s stands for system, used by administrators, require root
/bin and /sbin - for exes called early in the boot, before /usr is mounted
/usr/bin and /usr/sbin - for exes called after /usr is mounted
/usr/local - overrides will not be tampered with during package manager update

Special cases
/lib
/etc/init.d - startup scripts, services
Libraries are also executable?
What are bin, lib, share?

Where do configuration files live?
/etc
