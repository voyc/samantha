====== Service ======

The word "service" is used in different ways.

A service is a daemon that is started by systemd-init during startup and can be stopped, restarted, and status checked by an administrator.  The service may come with additional daemons, control programs and configuration files.

In this article we will answer the question: "How to start a program at boot?"

We will walk through four ways to run a program:  foreground, background, daemon, service.

===== Foreground =====

Each terminal session can have only one foreground job.

  * Foreground, requires user interaction.
  * Background, no user required.
  * Daemon is independent of any terminal.

  ctrl-Z - stop the process
  $ fg # continue process in foreground
  $ bg # continue process in background

  $ commandname & # start job in the background
  $ echo $!  # print the PID of the forked process, so you can kill it later
