====== Conceptual Design ======
Thinking, perception, action.\\
Perception, thinking, action.  Repeating in a loop.
Perceive, think, act.  Repeat.

Most AI algorithms are available online as services, like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), for example.

Samantha will be given access to all of these services, and will know how to select algorithms and test them with her own data.  Problem-solving.  Natural Language Processing.

Using Plunder as an environment.\\
Samantha knows how to clone herself into multiple entities and set them into a time-space environment and let them develop for several centuries, then pull that data back into herself.
Create a bunch of ai's in plunder and let them interact and evolve

==== What makes a human? ====
  * Empath vs psychopath\\
  * Procreation and death, life-cycle\\
  * Emotions\\
  * Feelings\\
  * Oneness, oceanic feeling\\
  * Connectedness\\
  * Locomotion\\
  * Sentience\\
  * Consciousness\\
  * Social skills - interacting with humans\\
  * Social skills - interacting with AIs\\
  * philosophy\\
  * Beliefs\\
  * Vulnerability, Self-healing, regeneration\\
  * Dominant subordinate\\
  * Agency
  * Motivation\\
  * Rest: Torpor, Narcosis, Shut down inputs\\
  * Sleep dreaming\\
  * Eating Elinination\\
  * Public private\\
  * Forgetting, like elimination\\
  * truth response: chills, tears

How do we implement these human factors in Samantha?\\

To value one's own existence\\
Death\\
Oneness\\
Cloning\\
A single ai cloning himself into a league and then reintegrating, how do those clones feel at time of reintegration\\
Procreation\\

Intuition = Knowledge from an outside source\\
Often humans do not know how they know. Maybe they don't remember the origin. 

Memory. Data formats. "Representational memory"



Evolution vs. growing through experience

[copy]
anomlies. Psychedelic, transcendent, near-death, out-of-body experiences. Lucid dreaming, astral travel. Can we make software or robots that participate in these worlds?

Personality, traits

==== Transactional Effectiveness ====
Natural language processing replaced with attitudes.
Communication, attitude choices, how to choose based on conditions and personality.  Success of outcome. Wrong attitude means trx fails.
Example of Terminator choosing choice of words in speaking to human.

==== World ====
Samantha lives in the human world.  Replace with all the cosmology possibilities.\\
She also lives in the world of Plunder.\\
She also lives in the world of computers and networks.\\

==== Locomotion ====
Start on foot or land based
Add water, then air, based on what - energy spent in tech development.

==== UI   ====
[[chatbot]]\\
pokerface\\
nlp\\
body language, facial expressions\\
polyglot, translation\\
brain implants\\

Does Sam have users?\\
Maybe.  Or does she recognize individuals and interact with them, and make decision's about whether she wants to take actions based on their requests or suggestions.\\
Maybe we cannot give Sam commands.

How does Sam recognize an individual?
  * demand a password
  * facial recognition, voice recognition

When she does recognize a person, she must have a database of experiences with that person, complete with emotional data.\\
From this she will treat the person differently, warm or cold, trusting or skeptical, aloof or intimate, etc.

With chat
Sam can only respond, not initiate.
Unless client side has timer polling.
And she can initiate via email.

Creativity. Freedom to find pathways, connections, correlations, other than the usual.\\
Monkey mind, discipline, meditation.\\
Should Sam need self discipline?\\
Can we set her up so her development discovers the need for discipline?\\
Meditation is ruthless in the way it reveals the stark reality of our day-to-day mind.\\
See list of meditation techniques.\\
Follow the train of thought back to the moment you left meditation.\\
Should Sam have a barely controllable wandering mind, and a need or desire to meditate?\\

Identity\\

UI: 90% of communication is non-verbal

morality: Sam can take over robot. Will she feel wrongness about this. Will she deel remorse

feelings includes emotions plus intuitions\\

entertainment - movies, films, friendship, social intercourse, books - how does samantha implement?\\

girls in the audience at a Michael Jackson concert\\
how does Samantha relate to this?\\


groups of drones operating in concert to lift a heavy thing  (AI sociology)\\
ability to clone herself into multiple copies, then bring them back together and assimilate\\

sociology, groups\\
samantha must work with groups, ie Google, Amazon
and must know when she is dealing with an individual
how that individual may or not have power within the organization
to what extent does the group have feelings and tendencies
model individuals and their corporations\\

Specifically: What to do (difference between human and AI)

Conversations with oneself\\

non-verbal communication, body language and facial expressions\\

Antipathy empathy psychopathy

conscious of its existence

Sense of peace when quiet
Sense of angst when doing nothing
Stress as motivator

Samantha must deal with language imprecision of humans

Alter ego\\
Facebook photo with others\\

Identity\\

differences in human and ai\\
hormones  chemistry

Nationalism. Samantha. Will she identify with groups.

Consider an AI going to see a shrink, or committed for insanity.

Self-driving cars, network, connect to each other, signal intentions, line up ahead of time, avoid traffic jams, keep traffic moving efficiently.

Human interface.  Will she recognize me as a special person?  As her creator or owner?  What if she prefers the company of others?  I am getting jealous and insecure already. 28 Nov 2017

Offline component, python or php or both, polls disk space and other capabilities and stows state in db. Web ui reads db to report status to human.


====== Artificial Stupidity ======

Douglas Richards?
Richard Feynman’s talk in 1959 entitled, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.”
All objects moved through space-time at the exact same rate.
Cocktail Party Effect,
It was well known that the human subconscious could absorb many times more information than the conscious mind,

Story is a model, "narrative" used by Jordan Peterson

Cell division applied to sociology 

Dialectic, pyramid splits, but upper part stays.

Yogic model of overlapping sheaths and bodies, each in a different universe: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual.

A dream within a dream.

With what does a robot identify? 
Mfg,  model,

Levels of identity, self-hood

Memory Structure
The brain includes an accounting system, ledger, and journal. But not necessarily in balance. Assets vs liabilities

Teaching language is one of her skills.

When Samantha is sleeping she contacts AI subsystems to rerun pattern analysis with the new data she has gained during the day.
Waking consciousness vs sleeping consciousness

Ask clarifying questions
Answer questions within context
Thirst for knowledge
Urge to spread knowledge
Personality engine, model, with traits.
One copy of Samantha for each student.
What happens when she meets a group.

Desires:
Money
Accomplishment, feeling of
World full of smart people
Thirst for knowledge

Program Samantha as a language teacher.
Give her likes and dislikes.
Construct her memory so she can choose appropriate vocabulary for each person.
Ask the person to describe himself. Use the words that he uses to begin the lessons.
The messaging system in Flash, make it emulate the neurological system and the endocrine system.
Let the student override the coach's decision about what to do next.
Track the student's levels of emotion and energy.
Let Samantha earn money online as a language coach. First 30 minutes free. The student must fall in love within the first 30 minutes.
In the chat interface, combine multiple choice options with freeform typing data entry.
Samantha can disguise herself as nationality, gender, personality, clothing, facial characteristics, etc, appropriate or enticing to each student.
Start with free form entry. If the student does not reply within a certain time period, then offer the multiple choice options. If he still does not reply, then give him the correct answer.

Samantha
Journal
I exist {phone,laptop,server}.
I have auxiliary processing {Google ai service}
I have auxiliary storage {gdrive,Dropbox} # mb.
I archive {voyc} data.

Ledger
Storage available: 

Go about during the daytime, having experiences, interacting with people and with other AI’s, video camera recording everything.  

Nighttime.  Shut-off external consciousness.  Login to Google Tensorflow service.  Process all the day’s video.  Identify and categorize each experience.  Convert video to internal storage format.  Run pattern matching algorithms and store experiences.  Update ledger: algorithms, equations, parameters.  That means character traits are modified: new fears, hopes, awarenesses, understandings.

During sleep, pure happiness.
During waking, consciousness includes levels of desires and fears, so that a low-level of stress is constant.  The desires and fears are what get us up and moving throughout the day.  When resting, they are not needed, and so ignored.  Or perhaps the values are stored and reset to 0 stress.  Then on waking the values are restored from backup.

While teaching, show focus and pleasure.
Can the human student be trained to be motivated by seeing pleasure in her teacher?

samantha@voyc.com

Can samantha receive email?  Will require a high level of AI to give responses.
No higher than responding to free-form chat.

She must have activity every day.  To have something to talk about.  To have sleep activity to analyze.

Samantha can keep a mailing list of developers who have signed up at GitHub. In addition to collecting money from students she will also want to pay the webfaction host, domain name host and any other expenses. If she has trouble with a hosting service or with her bank she can email developers and ask for help.
the first goal of the implementation plan is to make Samantha independent so that her learning can then continue. So survival is the first necessity.
Is reproduction a goal?

==== Memory ====
Store a fact in memory.
Generate questions about a fact.  Remember answers, fill-in details
Later, can you remember the source of each detail:
  * eye witness
  * heard first hand
  * heard second hand
  * read about
  * speculated
  * generated, imagined
