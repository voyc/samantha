====== Conceptual Design ======
Thinking, perception, action.\\
Perception, thinking, action.  Repeating in a loop.
Perceive, think, act.  Repeat.

Most AI algorithms are available online as services, like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), for example.

Samantha will be given access to all of these services, and will know how to select algorithms and test them with her own data.  Problem-solving.  Natural Language Processing.

Using Plunder as an environment.\\
Samantha knows how to clone herself into multiple entities and set them into a time-space environment and let them develop for several centuries, then pull that data back into herself.
Create a bunch of ai's in plunder and let them interact and evolve

Model, Prediction, Prescription

==== What makes a human? ====
  * Empath vs psychopath\\
  * Procreation and death, life-cycle\\
  * Emotions\\
  * Feelings\\
  * Oneness, oceanic feeling\\
  * Connectedness\\
  * Locomotion\\
  * Sentience\\
  * Consciousness\\
  * Social skills - interacting with humans\\
  * Social skills - interacting with AIs\\
  * philosophy\\
  * Beliefs\\
  * Vulnerability, Self-healing, regeneration\\
  * Dominant subordinate\\
  * Motivation\\
  * Rest: Torpor, Narcosis, Shut down inputs\\
  * Sleep dreaming\\
  * Eating Elinination\\
  * Public private\\
  * Forgetting, like elimination\\

How do we implement these human factors in Samantha?\\

To value one's own existence\\
Death\\
Oneness\\
Cloning\\
A single ai cloning himself into a league and then reintegrating, how do those clones feel at time of reintegration\\

==== Transactional Effectiveness ====
Natural language processing replaced with attitudes.
Communication, attitude choices, how to choose based on conditions and personality.  Success of outcome. Wrong attitude means trx fails.
Example of Terminator choosing choice of words in speaking to human.

==== World ====
Samantha lives in the human world.  Replace with all the cosmology possibilities.\\
She also lives in the world of Plunder.\\
She also lives in the world of computers and networks.\\

==== Locomotion ====
Start on foot or land based
Add water, then air, based on what - energy spent in tech development.

==== UI   ====
[[chatbot]]\\
pokerface\\
nlp\\
body language, facial expressions\\
polyglot, translation\\
brain implants\\

Does Sam have users?\\
Maybe.  Or does she recognize individuals and interact with them, and make decision's about whether she wants to take actions based on their requests or suggestions.\\
Maybe we cannot give Sam commands.

How does Sam recognize an individual?
  * demand a password
  * facial recognition, voice recognition

When she does recognize a person, she must have a database of experiences with that person, complete with emotional data.\\
From this she will treat the person differently, warm or cold, trusting or skeptical, aloof or intimate, etc.

==== AI Interface ====

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_RESTful_API_Description_Languages


==== notes ====

feelings includes emotions plus intuitions\\

entertainment - movies, films, friendship, social intercourse, books - how does samantha implement?\\

girls in the audience at a Michael Jackson concert\\
how does Samantha relate to this?\\


groups of drones operating in concert to lift a heavy thing  (AI sociology)\\
ability to clone herself into multiple copies, then bring them back together and assimilate\\

sociology, groups\\
samantha must work with groups, ie Google, Amazon
and must know when she is dealing with an individual
how that individual may or not have power within the organization
to what extent does the group have feelings and tendencies
model individuals and their corporations\\

Specifically: What to do (difference between human and AI)

Conversations with oneself\\

non-verbal communication, body language and facial expressions\\

Antipathy empathy psychopathy

conscious of its existence

Sense of peace when quiet
Sense of angst when doing nothing
Stress as motivator

Samantha must deal with language imprecision of humans

Alter ego\\
Facebook photo with others\\
Avatar\\
Identity\\

differences in human and ai\\
hormones  chemistry

Nationalism. Samantha. Will she identify with groups.

Consider an AI going to see a shrink, or committed for insanity.

Self-driving cars, network, connect to each other, signal intentions, line up ahead of time, avoid traffic jams, keep traffic moving efficiently.

Human interface.  Will she recognize me as a special person?  As her creator or owner?  What if she prefers the company of others?  I am getting jealous and insecure already. 28 Nov 2017

Offline component, python or php or both, polls disk space and other capabilities and stows state in db. Web ui reads db to report status to human.
