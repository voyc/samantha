==== Non-judgment ====
**What about Hitler?**
You talk about non-judgment, but surely you cannot say that Hitler was neither good nor bad?

Well let me ask you this. If you had a choice - Hitler or the internet - which would you choose? 

The internet was created as a DARPA project as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II.  There were six institutions working together.  Each of them had its own network of computers and they wanted these institutions computers to talk to each other, so they could share information quickly and efficiently.  So DARPA instructed them to link their networks together.  Two computers together in a network and develop protocols for sharing data across the computers.  From that, of course, the entire internet revolution occurred: the internet, email, the web.  It would not exist without the cooperation that was necessitated by Hitler's attack upon the world.

And so, suppose the master of the universe comes to you and he says, "Alright, we'll go back in time and you can fix things the way you want.  You can get rid of Hitler so it's as if he never existed.  And along with that the internet will disappear."  

So now it's your choice: Hitler or the internet, which do you choose.  Well I know what I would choose.  I'll take the internet. Screw it.  So what does that mean?  That means I'm a psychopath just as bad as Hitler himself. Everything that he did, I have that capability Within Myself.

====What is a prostitute?====
How are you using that word "prostitute"?

Well obviously it's a woman who sells sex for money.

So if I go out on the street, meet a girl and pay her $50 for a blowjob, that would be a prostitute, correct?

Yes.

What if it's a high-end call girl like the congressmen use and I have to pay her $3,000 for an all night experience?

Yes that's a prostitute.

Suppose I hire this girl several times and I decide that I want to have unprotected sex with her and so I negotiate an exclusive deal. she will have sex with me twice a week and in return I will give her an apartment, a car, and I will pay for her food and clothing and give her cash spending money of $10,000 per month. Is she still a prostitute?

Yes that is a prostitute.

What if I do not give her any cash but instead I give her jewelry worth the same she can convert some of the to cash as she wishes. Still a prostitute?

Yes she is still a prostitute.

So it's not about money, but any goods and services. Now let's say that my wife dies and after another year I decide that I would like to save the money on the apartment by moving the girl into my house. It's a big house she can have a wing of her own and all other aspects of our Arrangement remain the same, sex twice a week, the car, the clothing, the food, and the jewelry. She agrees. Is she still a prostitute?

Well, yes, she is.

Okay now one more change. Our Arrangement remains exactly the same, sex twice a week, the house, the car, the clothing, the food and the jewelry. And, I marry her. Is she still a prostitute?

You bastard. No she's not a prostitute.

So we modify the definition again. Now a prostitute is an unmarried woman who trades sex for goods and services.

Compare this to Bill Burr's use of the phrase "gold digging whore", applied to a woman who uses marriage as the tool to get money from the man.


====Non judgement: war====

How can you not judge War as bad?

Start with the proposition war is good. Find a context in which war is good. Here is a man who loves Humanity. He wants Humanity to thrive. When even one man dies he finds it a tragedy. So a war that takes so many lives diminishes Humanity and therefore for him war is bad.

Now here is another man who loves Humanity. But he has some additional information. He has received knowledge that Humanity 4000 years from now will face and extraterrestrial threat from a race of beings so powerful that we cannot even imagine. They will arrive in ships and teleporters by the hundreds of billions. With the intent of wiping out the human race and taking the Earth for themselves.

If humanity is to survive this threat it must spend the next four thousand years building up its destructive technologies and attitudes. To win at anything one must practice. To win this coming War we must practice. In World War II 60 million people died. That was only 3% of the world population at that time. That's nothing. In the coming War Earth people will have to kill hundreds of millions of the invading forces. The wars that Earth people fight among themselves are sparring competitions which enable us to develop the weapons, the skills, the tactics, the strategies necessary to develop Humanity into a force powerful enough to defend itself successfully in the universe.

In that context war is a good thing because it will allow Humanity to survive.

Now we can step back and see two scenarios, one in which war is good and the other in which war is bad. We can see that war is neither good nor bad. It's a matter of context.

  * the //catastrophe// of being human - Jordan Peterson

  * See the contradictions, the incongruities, the falsehood and the sorrow of the human state, the need to go beyond. — Nisargadatta Maharaj, I Am That

One mind

We project our reality

Scientific materialism

Scientific energism

====The Self====

Before we can consider self-awareness or self-consciousness, we must define the self. Here are some of the descriptions of the self.

The small self vs the higher self.  Oneness?  or Duality?

So ego, then, is the absence of true knowledge of who we really are, together with its result: a doomed clutching on, at all costs, to a cobbled together and makeshift image of ourselves, an inevitably chameleon charlatan self that keeps changing and has to, to keep alive the fiction of its existence.
— Sogyal Rinpoche
The Tibetan Book Of Living And Dying

====We are all Psychopaths==== 

Do you have kids? Have you ever taken them to eat at McDonald's? How could you do that? You know that stuff is poison. You are a psychopath.

====War is good====

To think clearly we must suspend judgement.

Remember the old George Carlin bit. What makes human beings unique is there capacity for war genocide torture suicide crime rape.

We tend to think of these things as bad. How can we suspend judgement? To start let's go the other way and assume that war is good. How can this be?

==== Perception vs Projection ====

What we see is what our karmic vision allows us to see, and no more.

Our motivational systems prime our sense perception.  The gorilla experiment.
