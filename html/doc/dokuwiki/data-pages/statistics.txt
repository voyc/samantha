===== Normal Distribution =====


==== Bell Curve ====
{{ ::bell_curve.png|}}

The _normal distribution_ is given by the equation
$$e^{\frac{-x^2}{2}}$$

When we actually have input data, we will use this equation.
$$y = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt[]{2\pi }}e^{\frac{(x-\mu )^2}{2\sigma ^2}}$$

Characteristics:
  * The curve is symmetric about the y axis.
  * The center portion is a convex parabola and has one maximum point.
  * To either side lies an inflection point where the line becomes a concave parabola.
  * The line stretches to the left and right, approaching the limit of zero.
  * The area under the curve totals 1.0, the total probability of any prediction.
