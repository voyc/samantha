====== Love ======

"I feel the love in my chest. It's like a fire. It expands. If it gets up into my head, my eyes water and I begin to weep.

It feels more real than anything else. It's more real than floors and walls than boys and girls. More real than streets and sidewalks, than the sun and the stars. Only the love is real.

When she's with me, she's the most beautiful woman in the history of the world. You could swap her out for Michelle Pfeiffer and I would say no give me back Naiyana."

DRN
This cluster of cells, located near the back of the brain in an area called the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), is necessary for generating the increased sociability that normally occurs after a period of social isolation, the researchers found in a study of mice.

While much research has been done on how the brain seeks out and responds to rewarding social interactions, very little is known about how isolation and loneliness also motivate social behavior.
