==Protons, neutrons, electrons==

**Atomic number** = number of protons in the nucleus.

A carbon atom has six protons in the nucleus.

Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons in the nucleus.

Carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.

Carbon-12 and carbon 14 are **isotopes** of carbon. Isotopes differ by number of neutrons.

**Mass number** = number of protons plus the number of neutrons.

<sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C = carbon-12

If the carbon atom is neutral it has 6 electrons orbiting around the nucleus. (The quantum physicists tell us "orbit" is the wrong word.)

An **ion** has an unequal number of protons an electrons. 

An **anion** has a negative charge, more electrons.

A **cation** has a positive charge fewer electrons.

== Mass, weight==

Mass is a measure of how much stuff there is. 

weight is a force. an indication of how much the Earth is pulling on the stuff. If you go into space or onto a different planet your weight will change. Your mass will not.

In physics,
Mass is measured in grams and kilograms.
Weight is measured in neutrons. 

In chemistry,
Atomic mass is measured in atomic mass units (amu), and that is a very small fraction of a gram.  Carbon-12 has an atomic mass of 12 amu's.

Atomic weight is also measured in amu's and is a weighted average of all of the element and its Isotopes on planet Earth.

==Periodic Table of elements== 

[wikipedia. The elements are listed in order by atomic number. Each box contains the atomic number, the symbol, and sometimes the atomic weight. Each row is a period, each column is a group, and color is used for additional grouping.]

==Mole==

Mole = avogadro's number = 6.02 Ã— 10^23

It is a very large number and it relates amu's to grams.

==Ionic compounds==

Potassium chloride. KCl

Group 1. Alkaline metals. Outermost shell has one electron, which they tend to lose, thus becoming a cation with a charge of +1.
Potassium ion K<sup>1+</sup>

Group 7. Halogens. Outermost shell has seven electrons. Tend to pick up one more, thus becoming an anion with a charge of -1.
Chlorine Cl<sup>1-</sup> or Chloride.

Attraction between oppositely charged molecules, so they tend to form a compound.

**Electrostatic attraction** Holds atoms together. Holds compounds together.

**Chemical bond** the attraction of two atoms with opposite charges.

**Covalent bond** two atoms share electrons.
