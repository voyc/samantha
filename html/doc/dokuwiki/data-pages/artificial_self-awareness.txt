====== Artificial Self-Awareness ======

All that is meant is that the Self is infinite inclusive of all that you see. There is nothing beyond It nor apart from It. Knowing this, you will not desire anything; not desiring, you will be content.\\

Levels of awareness\\
Sunflower is aware of sun position\\
Sensors temperature, vision obstacles, food, sex partner, smell, enemy, threat\\

Levels of self-awareness\\
Ego-self, small self, mind-body attachment\\
Big self, eternal divine self, oneness, universal soul\\

At what point does the organism become self aware. If he can recognize a threat, does this imply he sees himself as apart from others.

When an individual gains small-self awareness, does he lose big- self-awareness at that time? Universal - self awareness is non-self-awareness. Undifferentiated life stuff.

When a sunflower tracks the sun across the sky, is the sunflower aware that his position is changing?

Awareness.  \\

Self monitoring, self regulating.\\
The self-monitoring mechanism is aware of the sun position sensor. But is it aware of that awareness.\\

AI singularity\\
virtual immortality\\

The first is the "singularity," when artificial intelligence will redesign itself recursively and progressively, such that AI will become vastly more powerful than human intelligence ("superstrong AI"). The second revolution will be "virtual immortality," when the fullness of our mental selves can be uploaded perfectly to nonbiological media (such as silicon chips), and our mental selves will live on beyond the demise of our fleshy, physical bodies.

		idealism (west) == non-dualism (east)\\
		panpsychism: all matter has consciousness\\
		artificial sentience: engineers can create a being that has a private subjective inner life\\
		expressions of non-dualism\\
			Consciousness is a fundamental building block of reality like space-time and the properties of matter.\\
			The world we perceive is made of consciousness. What we call matter is consciousness itself.\\
			
		
Everything that had possessed me, all the agonies, disappeared like dreams and illusions, and something one might call "true nature" stood revealed.\\

Ego-self == personality\\

Rta - (Sanskrit ऋतं ṛtaṃ, “that which is properly/excellently joined; order, rule; truth") is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.[1] In the hymns of the Vedas, Ṛta is described as that which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders. 

Dharma - the injunctions and ordinances thought to uphold Rta.

Karma - the action of the individual in relation to Dharma.

Amrita - immortality, nectar, soma, a drink that confers immortality.  Also, a common first name.
