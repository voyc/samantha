===== Component Model =====

samd - daemon, sub-component broca listens on socket

samrepl - backdoor to samd from terminal on samd host

samchat - websockets webchat server

samwsgi - linked into passenger_wsgi.py, to implement ajax calls to sam

One of the skills is "reception".  FirstSam is the receptionist, accepts logins, and routes to proper CloneSam.  No other clone needs the reception skill, unless he is running on a different computer.  Or, like groups, maybe each clone can accept logins, if he is connected to a socket.  All broca's have a socket.  Maybe the reception should be peer to peer, round-robin, to find the correct SamClone.  Do a test with two clones talking to each other.  Who keeps a list of broca sockets.  Each broca has a pointer to the next.  That would mean chaining through all the sockets with each message.

Two socket systems:
  * The websockets system creates one client socket for each user.
  * The Receptionist does what?

Can a socket talk to a websocket?

sockets and threading

socketserver.ThreadingUnixStreamServer

use ps -e to find threads for each socket for each user

====== User and Mind ======

main article: [[Mind, Thought, Language]]

humans each have vocab and memory (memory?)                                                                      
                                                                                                         
each sam clone has memory and access to full dict                                                      
                                                                                                         
during sleep, local memories of humans and clones are collected into boss.collective memory            
                                                                                                         
boss, collective, updated during sleep                                                                   
        dick: list,tree  Dick() whoswho, gazeteer, history, fact book                                    
        lang: en, th, s3  Lang()                                                                         
        gramr  - Gramr()  collapsed rules derived from thots in conversations                            
        memri -  Memri()  a list of conversations                                                        

sam
        skills
        langs
        , on wake, downloads mind from collective
                dick
                lang
                memri - ? collective or personal, learned from conversation, pulled from collective
                gramr

lee, on wake, downloads mind from collective
        memri
        skills, can connect, but not listen
                no lobby, but can converse
        langs


humans and clones are running in separate processes, separate computers

therefore, each clone must have his own copy of dict and lang

on wakeup from sleep
        each clone reloads dick, memri, gramr

===== User and Skills =====

{{:uml_class_userskill.png?400|}}


===== Lobby =====

{{:uml_class_lobby.png?400|}}

===== Converse =====

=== command processing ===

incoming message is an imperative command

command <options> <arguments>

each command has a specific vocabulary and syntax

=== conversation ===

incoming message is a thought, be it statement, question, exclamation, or imperative

thought = vocabulary and syntax

language = thought plus pronunciation and more syntax

=== Samese ===

A pidgin language based on English and Python.

verb with modifiers = command with arguments

the medium of thought

=== Translation ===

parse - translate incoming message into a Samese Thot

generate - translate a Samese Thot into into outgoing message

=== Commands ===

Account (Security):

Reception

===== Boot =====

=== 1. samd.py ===

get name, addr, skillnames from db or config

Instantiate sam.user.Sam()

=== 2. sam/user.py ===

define classes User, Human, Sam

Sam::init() loads the skills, including Lobby

=== 3. sam/lobby.py ===

define classes: Switchboard, Security, Translate, Dispatch, Reception

instantiate one of each

Switchboard::init() 
  - instantiate sam.comm.Server()
  = switchboard.listen()

=== 4. sam/comm.py ===

defines classes Message, Server, Client

implements websockets

supports Message-passing between Server and Client sockets

  Sam::boot()
    Lobby::boot()
      Switchboard::listen()
        Server::listen()

=== import, instantiate, init, setup, rebirth, wake ===

security, clearance = admin, allow even when asleep
if not admin and asleep, dispatch not called

background processes, if any, sleep thot reorg, dreaming

import
   samd
      sam/user.py
         sam/skill.py
         sam/echo.py
         sam/lobby.py
            sam/comm.py
         sam/mind.py

instantiate and __init__()
   samd
      Sam(User)
          Lobby()
             Switchboard()
             Security()
             Translator()
             Dispatcher()
             Reception()
          Mind()
          
setup
   mind.think()

rebirth
   lobby.listen()

wake
   status from sleep to wake (allows dispatch of messages from non-admin users)

sleep vs wake
sleep
   mind does reorg of thots and grammar
   dispatch only of admin-level messages
wake
   dispatch all messages
   turn off background thot reorg

skills
    mind - cortex is not required, can be added on top
       if no mind, cannot think, but can run, fight, fuck, eat, battery management
    lobby: gate, censor
       if no lobby, cannot communicate
    translate - always required if lobby, to build thots from strings 
        multi languages
    reception - if not present, groups?, allow chat rooms with multiple participants
    
===== Login =====

Example of command processing wrapped in conversation.  Input parser must treat these as the same thought.  

  login John x42#pw
  
  login username=John password=x42#pw
  
  Hi.  My name is John and my password is x42#pw.
  
  What is your name?
     John
  What is your password?
     x42#pw

Grammar includes commands, specifically.


switchboard
security: check token: anonymous or logged-in level
translate parse
dispatch: assume converse mode by default
dispatch can call security or account for login, etc.

in translate parse, we match thot to grammar patterns
this would include imperative commands like login and change password


==== Message Processing ====

   Lobby:init()
      instantiate Switchboard, Security, Reception, Dispatcher
      call Switchboard::listen()
         instantiate Server() 
         call Server::listen() passing switchboard::onMessage() as callback
      Switchboard::onMessage()
         store/match user by addr into Lobby::users list
         call Security::check() to get clearance
            lookup token in db, translate to clearance, return
         call Dispatcher::dispatch()
            parse message-in
            set/clear command mode "on/off"
            match command to ?list? 
            call skill object::cmd_command() associated with this command
            method optionally returns a reply
         return to Server with reply Message
      
===== Conversational Machine Learning =====

entity, relation
ambiguities in language = attempts to flatten a rounded shape
thought may be linear, but is also in the shape of a torus 

noun verb noun
consonant vowel consonant
in sanskrit alphabet, vowels are secondary to consonants
in latin alphabet, vowels are equal to consonants

verb has no meaning without a subject
differences in grammar explain the differences in thought
adj before or after noun
can verb have meaning without subject
is where and adv or adj


noun verb noun
event = noun verb noun
thot = verb, subj and obj are modifiers of the verb
thot = noun (subj),  verb is modifier of the noun

how to string thoughts together?
is a verb a thought?  yes 
is a preposition a thought?  yes 
is an article a thought?  yes 

naiyana comes to chiangmai is a complete thought
or is it three separate thoughts
or is it one thought connected to another thought

expats go_from chiangmai to avoid smoke in February
naiyana come_to chiangmai to visit john next week

entity, relation
entity a
relation a, b
