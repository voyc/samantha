===== Component Model =====

samd - daemon, sub-component broca listens on socket

samrepl - backdoor to samd from terminal on samd host

samchat - websockets webchat server

samwsgi - linked into passenger_wsgi.py, to implement ajax calls to sam

One of the skills is "reception".  FirstSam is the receptionist, accepts logins, and routes to proper CloneSam.  No other clone needs the reception skill, unless he is running on a different computer.  Or, like groups, maybe each clone can accept logins, if he is connected to a socket.  All broca's have a socket.  Maybe the reception should be peer to peer, round-robin, to find the correct SamClone.  Do a test with two clones talking to each other.  Who keeps a list of broca sockets.  Each broca has a pointer to the next.  That would mean chaining through all the sockets with each message.

Two socket systems:
  * The websockets system creates one client socket for each user.
  * The Receptionist does what?

Can a socket talk to a websocket?

sockets and threading

socketserver.ThreadingUnixStreamServer

use ps -e to find threads for each socket for each user
