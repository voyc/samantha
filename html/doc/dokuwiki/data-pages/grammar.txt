====== Grammar ======

Ambiguities in language: we are trying to flatten a rounded structure

like making a flat map from a globe

===== Multiple trees =====
Trees as optional connections
Pos
Male female
Height size
Types of thought, syllogism, dialectic

===== instance vs class =====

in every relation, make every entity an instance

	whenever a modify is done to a noun
		an instance is required
	every relation is by nature an instance
		the nouns in the relation are not instances unless explicitly stated

	a thought can be about a class or about an instance

	family of Nid      typeof family, no name, owned by Nid
	Jerry              typeof person, named Jerry
	
	instance, named, permanent
	temporary, only for purpose of the current thought
	can we create temp instances, without putting them in the mind.entities dict?

	any propername is an instance
		Bangkok, has a population and area, etc

	Ethel's lasagna - is a class, but can have modifiers
		a dish of Ethel's lasagna is actually an instance
		is Ethel's lasagna a named entity
		car
			petro car
			electric car
		These are classes, but could have modifiers, no?
		in an instance, the modifier delineates the entity
		in a class, the modifier defines the class

		the Honda EV is a class 
			and it has modifiers that define the class
			if John owns one, that is an instance, color red deliniates it
				the class has a name, the instance does not

===== subj verb obj =====

	two options
	subj:Objek -> link/verb:Objek -> obj:Objek
	verb:Objek
		modifier
			subj Objek
			obj  Objek
			why
			where
		
	"object" and "entity" imply a noun		
	"instance" - can also be a verb or a link.  is that true?

	Joe is a terminal klass
	Bangkok is a terminal klass, but we need to make an Objek of it in a thot

	the thot is listed as a thot
		objeks are not listed, but referenced directly within the thot


	a relation names up to three parts
		each of the three can have modifiers

	a klass can have modifiers too

	common names of persons, Node?
	who's who, instances of persons, public
	friends, instances of persons, private

	proper names
		persons
			common names, index of  - klas, not objek
			who's who - objek, global mind
			my contacts - objek, private mind
		places Gazetteer
			countries
			provinces
			cities
			neighborhoods
			streets
		businesses directory
			business names and type


		mind.contacts.print()

mind.gazetteer.toString()
mind.whoswho.toString() - including my contacts, global phone book
mind.businessdirectory.toString()

===== generate grammar =====

	x enumerate relation acces
	enumerate klass	
	enumerate klass instance
	classify enumeration by link
	
	loop thru klas, for each
		list modifiers	
		sort and count by link
		list usage as subj, how many times used as subj
		list usage as obj
			how many times used as obj of verb
			how many times used as obj of modifier


where you go
grocery store
why
because i am hungry

why
to buy food
why
to eat the food
why
because I'm hungry
where will you eat the food
at home

go grocery store, buy food, return home, eat food
why: i hungry

go restaurant, eat food
why: i hungry

shortcut
sequential verb phrases, all with implied subject

relation is subject plus verb phrase
	"empty" -> "implied" for subject
	"empty" -> "unspecified" for object

relation is phrase: verb, adj, adv

two ways to represent relation:
	verb: subject and object are modifiers
	noun: verb phrase is modifier

houn: modifier timestamp is time we first heard about this  modifier
verb: timestamp is time the action took place


Bangkok on the earth
Bangkok on a map  - map of Bangkok
model of Bangkok
photo
same Bangkok, one real, one representation

Nid, photo of Nid, photo of Nid
Nid, clone, clone of Nid, Nid is now klas
all representations "of", until you clone it 


vocabulary - semantic hierarchy

syntactic hierarchy



thoughts can be expressed in a variety of ways
	verb first, noun first, etc
	I suppose they could be stored in a variet of ways also
	so just pick one way and go with it
	remember Alan Watts saying every noun is an action, a being

a verb timestamp is the time or period of the action (when)
a noun timestamp is the time i first heard about this attribute

do we want timestamps?  other than the when  modifier?
yes we want the timestamp and the source(user) of every thot
though these will not be used in normal conversation, only in self-reflection

verb phrase includes modifiers, including link to object
noun phrase includes modifiers
sentence is noun phrase + verb phrase
a thought can start anywhere: subj or verb, is that true?

duplicate relations
	must be separate so they can be modified
	they happen at different times, so are different thoughts and must be recorded
	therefore, accesscount is never more than 1
	a relation is like an objek in that sense

scan modifiers
scan relations

scan modifiers now, then add relations


patterns:
	@person
		verbs
			links
				objects
