English language is good for describing external things but very limited for internal dimensions, aspects of who we are. 

Using the yoga terms, the word jaagrithi refers to wakefulness.

<code>
ed: 
Sadhguru's pronunciation of these sanskrit words is confusing.  Can find no other reference to the word jaagrithi.  The online Spoken Sanskrit dictionary uses jāgara or jāgarati for watchfulness.

from Yogapedia:\\
Jagrat – the waking state in which consciousness is focused outward.\\
Svapna – the dream state in which consciousness is focused inward.\\
Sushupti – the deep sleep state in which consciousness roams the universe separate from the mind.\\
Turiya – the state of transcendental, or pure, consciousness in which the focus with both outward and inward at the same time.
</code>

Wakefulness of the mind and body.  But this is not the same as consciousness.

Some combination of memory and intelligence, we refer to as mind.  We do not consider the brain as a significant aspect of mind, because memory is is spread throughout the whole of the body.  Every cell in the body contains more memory than the brain can hold.  It remembers the skin color of your forefathers for a million years.

We have an over-reliance on the brain and thought.  In the yogic sciences, we pay no attention to thought.  It is of no consequence.  Whatever a person is saying, we don't listen to them.  We just feel them.  What is their chemistry?  This is how must creatures in the jungle judge you.  When handling a cobra, if you show agitation he will bite you and kill you; if you are at peace, you can handle him safely.

We give no attention to thought, because it is merely a recycling of data we already have.  No new fresh thought can come.  Only permutations of data we already have.

Because AI is taking over all data-based processes, now is a good time to explore an intelligence beyond the intellect.

So being wakeful and being conscious are two different things.

==jaagrithi = wakefulness==

There are different levels of wakefulness.  Take 10 people, all go to sleep, wake up.  Some wake up immediately, some in a few minutes or a couple hours, some need strong coffee.

==Svapna = dream state==

Far more vivid than wakefulness for most human beings.  Like going to the cinema.  The key impact on you is the turning off the lights.  Bring the eyelids, the shutters, down.  Close off the world.  Now you start your own world.

Wakefulness is useful for performing action in the world.  But for human consciousness, the dream state is more profound.

==Sushupti = dreamless==

But aware.  There are dimensions of consciousness of which we are aware, in this dreamless state.  There are no pictures, no people, no words, but you are conscious.  If you want to manifest something in your life, this level should be explored.

==Turiya = consciousness==

No memory involved of any kind. An intelligence beyond memory.  If there is memory, memory is considered a boundary. This is one person and that is another person simply because this body embodies one kind of memory and that body embodies another kind of memory. 

Not just what I remember and you remember, but:\\
Genetic memory\\
Evolutionary memory\\
Elemental memory\\
Atomic memory\\
Karmic memory\\
Articulate memory\\
Inarticulate memory\\
Conscious memory (what you and I remember)

Eight dimensions of memory.

I a person and a cow both eat mangos, they do not begin to resemble one another.  The human stays human, the cow stays a cow.  Evolutionary memory is perfect.

People are thinking their thoughts are free - this is a joke.  Memory is determining everything.

We call this karma.  Karma = the residual impact of all the memories you have.  Everything you are now - the way you are, the way you sit, stand, breath, perceive life - is determined by this memory.

But there is an intelligence beyond memory, which we call turiya or chitta.  This is consciousness.

Everyone is conscious.  A pig is conscious.  A rock is conscious.  The question is only of degree.
 
Blowing a soap bubble. Very small amount of soap. The bubble is mostly air. The soap is memory. The air is consciousness. We each blow a bubble. There is your bubble and my bubble. When the bubbles pop there is no my air and your air. So it is with consciousness.  There is no such thing as your consciousness and my consciousness.

There is something called your body and my body.  There is something called your memory and my memory.  There is something called your intellect and my intellect.  But there is nothing called your consciousness and my consciousness.

How much of it did you capture?  How big of bubble you blow determines the scale and possibilities of your life.

The only way human beings know time is by the cyclical movement of things that are happening.

Physical existence is a minuscule part of the larger space. My experience is only the footprint.

Your physical things are accumulations, not you.

If we disengage from the physical, from the accumulations, from the cyclical movement of things, there is no time. And because there is no time there is no space.

In the yoga sciences we look only at time. There is no space. Because there is time, there is the consequence of space.

Kala = time

We have no words for time and space. We have only one word, kala. Kala means time. Kala also means emptiness. Emptiness means space.

Mahakala, The greater time, has no cyclical movements.

When we disengage from the physical, disengage from memory, the physical sense of time and space disappear.

4 categories of intelligence:\\
Bhuddi = intellect\\
Ahankara\\
Manas = the silo of memory\\
Chita\\

Discriminatory intellect, a cutting tool, a survival mechanism.

A cosmic identity.
Aham bramasme.
Must be taught to children before teaching ABC's.

Intellect is based on identity.

Manas = the silo of memory

Chita, unsullied by memory.

Four dimensions of intelligence.

Memory is the basis of boundary.

In meditation one experiences death and thereby increases death mastery.
