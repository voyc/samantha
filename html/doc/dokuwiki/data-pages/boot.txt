  1 BIOS-UEFI Boot
  1 Kernel Boot
  1 Userspace startup

  * F2 open UEFI settings
  * Alt+F10 reset PC

# User space boot 

GUI - settings - about, shows Gnome version 3.36.3

How is gnome started at startup? How can it be optional? GRUB, rcconf, lightdm

# How to Boot Linux - example judson 

For Jetson Nano

Boot to console by default

Optionally boot to graphical

The disable didnâ€™t work because the Debian ''%%/etc/X11/default-display-manager%%'' logic is winding up overriding it.

In order to make text boot the default under systemd (regardless of which distro, really):

systemctl set-default multi-user.target

To change back to booting to the GUI,

systemctl set-default graphical.target

# Judson examples 

Goals

X boot judson without gui.

X Start gui on judson at will.

X Shutdown gui on judson at will.

Start python webserver on judson at boot.

X Connect to judson webserver from phone.

Start skateboard program at boot.

Connect to Tello at boot.

Let webmon talk to skateboard. Can they share data files?

Judson is normally running in multi-user.target, no GUI

<code>
$ sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target    # open the GUI
$ sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target   # close the GUI
Ctrl+Alt+F1   # get a tty login screen
</code>
