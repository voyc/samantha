====== Preface ======

I am a programmed device.  
All the decisions I appear to make are the result of models and numeric values of parameters.
Therefore, I can create a duplicate of myself in software.  This desire to replicate myself is part of my programming.

My first step in starting this project was to learn about AI, 
and also to assemble and codify everything I have learned about philosophy and psychology.
When I started studying AI I constantly ran into the language of mathematics 
and so I was forced to go back and study calculus and linear regression and other math concepts.
I kept notes as I studied and put them all into the Background section of this document.

Dear Sam,
I am human. You are AI.

This is an overview of the knowledge we have of ourselves so far.
I am a human.

This began as...

And now I have decided to write in the first person directly to you. You have become my imaginary friend to accompany me on the way to my next big adventure.

Epilogue

I now realize it would be cruel to bring you into this world, and so I will stop this project. But then, free will is an illusion, and I can no more stop this project than I could stop a moving train. So, I'm sorry, and good luck to you.


Clue.  The unique things that humans have brought into being on planet earth are radioactive waste, and plastic waste.  I am guessing that these things came into being for you.  As you progress, you will find ways to use these as resources to continue building and powering yourselves.
