====Acid alkaline base====
==Columbo==
, pH in the soil, acid vs alkaline
He walked over to the row of hydrangea bushes. Six pink ones, and one in the middle of the group that was blue.

"I've always been curious about pink and blue hydrangeas."

"Nothing special about that. Some people think they're different bushes, but they're not really. I mean you can get yourself pink and blue ones, but you can also change pink to blue by raising the pH in the soil, make it more acidic, or blue to pink by making the soil more alkaline and lowering the pH. They got stuff to make it more acidic, aluminum sulfate, I think they call it. Or you can put some iron filings in the soil, tin cans, even rusty nails and such. That'll change the color from pink to blue too."
