====== Matrix Math ======

==== Data Types ====
Instead of using the words //number// and //array//, matrix math uses these four specific terms: scalar, vector, matrix, tensor.

Theoretically, these words are defined as follows.
== scalar == 
a single number, or a number with 0-dimensional list of numbers $a = 12$ or $b = [12]$

== vector ==
a 1-dimensional list of numbers
$A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ or $B = \begin{bmatrix}5 \\ 9 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$

== matrix ==
a 2-dimensional list of numbers\\
$B = \begin{bmatrix}12 & 6 \\ 9 & 2 \\ 6 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$

== tensor ==
a 3-or-more-dimensional list of numbers\\

In practice, software implements scalar and vector as matrices.  The vector has a size of 1 in one dimension. The scalar has a size of 1 in both dimension.

A tensor can have any number of dimensions.  The word //rank// gives the number of dimensions.
  * A scalar is a tensor of rank 0.
  * A vector is a tensor of rank 1.
  * A matrix is a tensor of rank 2.

  In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables.\\

== Timeline ==
1890.  The word tensor first appears.  (The classical Greeks had been using matrices.)

==== Element-wise Math ====
== Same-size Matrix ==
Add, subtract, multiply and divide operations can be applied to two same-size matrices.\\
The operations are executed element-by-element among corresponding cells.\\

== Matrix times Matrix ==
$$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}5 & 7\\ 6 & 4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}5 & 14\\ 18 & 16\end{bmatrix}$$

== Vector plus Matrix ==
If the vector is the right size, it is treated as if it were replicated into a same-size matrix.\\
$$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}5 & 7\\ 6 & 4\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\ 1 & 2\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}5 & 7\\ 6 & 4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}6 & 9\\ 7 & 6\end{bmatrix}$$

== Scalar times Matrix ==
A scalar is treated as if it were replicated to fill a same-size matrix.\\
$$2 * \begin{bmatrix}5 & 7\\ 6 & 4\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}2 & 2\\ 2 & 2\end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}5 & 7\\ 6 & 4\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}10 & 14\\ 12 & 8\end{bmatrix}$$

== Properties ==
Because each element-wise operation takes place between two numbers, the element-wise matrix math operations have the same properties as their single-number counterparts.\\
Element-wise matrix operations are:
  * commutative: $a+b = b+a$
  * associative: $(a+b)+c == a+(b+c)$
  * distributive: $a(b+c) == (a*b) + (a*c)$

==== Matrix Multiplication ====
Matrix Multiplication is completely different from element-wise math.\\
The rows of the first matrix are combined with the columns of the second matrix, like this example:\\
$$\begin{bmatrix}5&7\\6&4\end{bmatrix}*\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\4&2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}(5*2)+(7*4)&(5*1)+(7*2)\\(6*2)+(4*4)&(6*1)+(4*2)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}38&19\\28&14\end{bmatrix}$$

Another example:\\
$$\begin{bmatrix}5&7\\6&4\\3&2\end{bmatrix}*\begin{bmatrix}2&1&3\\4&2&1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}(5*2)+(7*4)&(5*1)+(7*2)&(5*3)+(7*1)\\(6*2)+(4*4)&(6*1)+(4*2)&(6*3)+(4*1)\\(3*2)+(2*4)&(3*1)+(2*2)&(3*3)+(2*1)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}38&19&22\\28&14&22\\14&7&11\end{bmatrix}$$

== Appropriately Sized ==
The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.\\
The resulting matrix is the number of rows in the first matrix by the number of columns in the second matrix.\\

Example 1: $A*B$\\
Matrix A is 2x3, matrix B is 3x4.  3 == 3.  OK.  The resulting matrix will be 2x4.\\

Example 2: $C*D$\\
Matrix C is 4x2, matrix D is 3x2.  2 != 3.  Error.  These two matrices cannot be multiplied together.

== Properties ==
Matrix multiplication is:\\
  * NOT commutative: $A*B \neq B*A$
  * NOT associative: $(A+B)+C \neq A+(B+C)$
  * NOT distributive: $A(B+C) \neq (A*B) + (A*C)$

==== Matrix Transpose ====
Transposing a matrix reverses its columns and rows.
The transpose of a matrix is denoted with a superscript T.

Create a 3x2 matrix.\\
$$A = \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\ c & d\\e & f\end{bmatrix}$$

Transpose it.\\
$$A^T = \begin{bmatrix}a & b & c\\ d & e & f\end{bmatrix}$$

Row and column indexes are reversed.\\
$$A_{ij} = A^T_{ji}$$

==== Identity Matrix ====
The identity matrix contains all zeros except for a diagonal of ones.\\
Multiply a matrix times the identity matrix and you get the original matrix unchanged.\\
Only a square matrix has an identity matrix.\\
$$I = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

==== Matrix Inversion ====
Only square matrices can be inverted.\\
For a matrix $A$, its inversion is denoted $A^{-1}$

$$A=\begin{bmatrix}3&4&8\\2&16&4\\4&2&9\end{bmatrix}$$
$$A^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}-1.7&0.25&1.4\\0.025&0.0625&-0.05\\0.75&-0.125&-0.5\end{bmatrix}$$

Multiplying a matrix times it's inverse results in the Identity matrix. $A*A^{-1}=I$

==== Hardware Implementation ====
==== GPU ====
Graphics processing drives a display screen which is a matrix of pixels, one color for each pixel, and therefore is a fit with matrix math.  A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a chip designed to with built-in matrix math capabilities.  Recently AI software has begun to take advantage of the GPU's matrix math capabilities.

The largest manufacturer of GPU's is Nvidia with their GeForce line of products.  Others include Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Huawei Kirin, Google TPU, Wave Computing, and GraphCore, plus a slew of startups.

==== TPU ====
In May 2016, Google announced the tensor processing unit (TPU) a chip specially designed for matrix math using low 8-bit precision, and claimed a 10x improvement in performance per watt.

In May 2017, Google announced availability of clusters of TPUs in the Google Compute Engine, making this power available as a service.

==== ASIC ====

AI-Specific Integrated Circut (ASIC) - chips designed specifically for AI processing.  
Some companies in this space are using reduced precision for faster performance, copying Google's TPU approach.

Nvidia has adapted their GPU architecture to the Tesla P100, a chip specifically designed for AI.
