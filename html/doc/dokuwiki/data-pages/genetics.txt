Gene transfer - the transfer of genetic information between organisms.  Can be vertical or horizontal.

Vertical gene transfer is better known as sexual reproduction, from parent to offspring.

Horizontal gene transfer is directly from one organism to another.

==== Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) ====

aka Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) 

mechanisms
  * transformation
  * transduction
  * conjugation



===== Genetic Engineering =====

Gene delivery = artificial HGT
