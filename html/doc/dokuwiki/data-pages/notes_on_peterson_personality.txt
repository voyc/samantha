Definition of personality

Personality is unfathomable. there are more connections among neurons in the human brain then there are subatomic particles in the universe. The study of personality is daring and hopeless.

Approach this course as if you are an engineer of the human spirit.

As humans interact we tell each other what we want and what we do not want. We are co-creating personalities, our own and others.

How the Big Five was created. Lists of adjectives. Factor analysis.

====02/03: Historical & Mythological Context====
https://youtu.be/HbAZ6cFxCeY

Jonah and the Whale.

Some of Grimm's fairy tales are 15,000 years old.

Camille Paglia: ignorant professors. 

What the world is made of.\\
How we should act.

Natural rights.\\

In tribal groups, death by violence is very high.  As tribal groups unite into civilization, new rules are necessary.

Soul, psyche, unconscious

Admiration, contempt = an implicit morality.

You cannot act without a morality. Because the only reason to act is to make things better. And the word "better" implies good vs bad.

Story of Lion King. Paradise Lost. Paradise regained.

Story of Jonah. God tells Jonah to fix the evil city. Jonah refuses. Storm comes. They blame Jonah and throw him into the sea. Swallowed by whale and lives there three days. 

You cannot run from your destiny.
You need meaning.
The whale is the dragon. Chaos. The brain circuits used to fight predators are reused to fight the unknown.

Key to understand ancient stories.

We are nested inside a dream. Inside stories. Outside the stories is the unknown.

To be punished for your virtues. Jesus. Harry Potter.

The Divine hero has two sets of parents, earthly and heavenly.

You have an ethical duty to straighten things out. And if you don't do it, life will be hell.

St George and the dragon.

You can't understand yourself until you see that you are a monster.

We learn the hard way. The importance of a lesson is proportional to the pain of the learning.

Face the things you are afraid of. Let the thing occur and wait for the rebirth.

All the world is a stage, and ...
Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

==The hero myth==

  * Go out where no one has gone before.
  * Face the terrors of the unknown.
  * Gather something of value.
  * Return.

The central story, or in the top three stories.

1:18:30

Universal in human being:
  * Self conscious. We know of our own existence and limitations. Innate terror and fragility.
  * Seeks the good. Seeks revenge.
  * We live in a society. For a long time. Serotonin system is found in lobsters. Reputation is important.
  * Society also has two elements: repressive and cooperative.
  * Outside is the unknown.

==1:23:54 break between lectures 03 & 04==

Voyage to the underworld. #story

Voyage into the unconscious (Jung). The parts of you are personalities, not mathematical components. Many cases of PTSD are about things we've done, not seen.

Society regulates our emotions.
Match between what you do and what society expects.

The societal structure is a elaborated dominance hierarchy. Rising high in the dominance hierarchy increases serotonin levels. This means happy things make you happier, and sad things make you less sad. At the bottom of the hierarchy, nothing makes you happy and everything makes you nervous.

The Psychoanalysts.

Chaos represented in stories.

Meaning. Pre-verbal thought.

Females are choosey and devious.

Bower bird. An appreciation of beauty. The male's nest.

Social-cognitive architecture. We look at the world as if it's personified. Like children's cartoons.

Woman's face, red sports car, cocaine produce an activation in the reward system in the brain. Dopamine. It's an approach symbol, not satiation. Happiness is moving toward a reward. Not the reward itself.

Nature tries to kill you. Culture keeps you alive. Stories tell you which things are good and bad.

====04/05: Heroic and Shamanic Initiations====

https://youtu.be/wLc_MC7NQek

Our world is other people. Arranged in a dominance hierarchy.

Psychoanalysts: Freud, Jung.

Jung would create creatures and have conversations with them.

Initiation, transformation.

Jung. Hero's journey is into the unconscious. The pathway to wisdom is through hell.

There is something you must say or do. Refuse, oppressed.  Resentment. Insane.

Sacrifice. Pay now for a better future. Delayed gratification. #pattern

Money is a promise that the sacrifice you make now will pay off in the future.

Shamans in Amazonia. Ayahuasca. Two plants. How did they learn the formula. The plants told us.

Shamanic experience.

Ayahuasca. Openness increases. Metrics.
John Hopkins LSD experiments. Participants say it's the most important experience in life.
DMT. Everyone reports they see beings who tell them things.


2:35:40 Scandinavian drawing. Amazonia drawing. Tree that unites earth with heaven. Tree surrounded by snakes: a very real reality for our ancestors.


====06: Jean Piaget & Constructivism====

https://youtu.be/BQ4VSRg4e8w

Most famous developmental psychologist.

But he considered himself a genetic epistemologist.

Epistemology: how knowledge structures work. Genetic: formulation of. How children formulate their knowledge structures in the world.

Constructivist. The belief that humans construct the world.

Thomas Kune, philosophy of science.

Piaget:
As a child grows:
1. He acquires a set of facts and theories. 

2. He is confronted with anomalies in his set of facts and theories.

3. He acquires a new, larger, more complete set of facts and theories with the anomalies resolved, through assimilation and accommodation.

Assimilation = fill in the details.

Accommodation = transformation of the whole structure.

Peterson says this structure is a repeat of the hero myth. 1. order. 2. Chaos. 3. Return.

Peterson likens states 1 and 3 to Newtonian vs. Einsteinian physics. The first state is a nested subset within the larger state.

Bridge the gap between science and values (religion).

Procedural memory vs. representational memory.

Infant starts life by building procedural memory of how to use his body. No representational memory yet. Perhaps that's why we cannot remember our infancy.

20:00 breast feeding. In-built behavior, modified by the need to get along with mother.

22:30 an emergent morality. Social interactions emerge within a bounded space, the space of the game.




====07: Carl Jung and the Lion King (Part 1)====
====08: Carl Jung and the Lion King (Part 2)====


Introduction to Big Five.

Analytics company has you in their database and has tagged you by personality by looking at your Facebook activity. Advertisements are targeted specifically at you individually. News articles also.
 
Colombine shooters

A really bad guy who raped 1200 men, burned buildings, tried to start a war between UK and Canada.

18:45 Back to Lion King, Simba and Nala in hell. Malevalence.




====09: Freud and the Dynamic Unconscious====
====10: Humanism & Phenomenology: Carl Rogers====
====11: Existentialism: Nietzsche Dostoevsky & Kierkegaard====
====12: Phenomenology: Heidegger, Binswanger, Boss====
====13: Existentialism via Solzhenitsyn and the Gulag====

====14: Introduction to Traits/Psychometrics/The Big 5====

https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY

Extroversion\\
Neuroticism\\
Agreeableness\\
Conscientiousness\\
Openness to experience\\

Clinical psychology is Engineering

Measurement is key

Social psychology is rife with scandal because their measurements are not instantiated properly.

Why are there five traits?
Factor analysis. Other traits are correlated with one of these five.

Ask questions. Surveys. Tests.

IQ is not a personality trait, but is tested similarly.

Traits manifest in:
  * World view
  * goals
  * behaviors
  * motivations
  * values

World view examples

Openness: the world is a place of opportunities to talk about ideas, aestuitics

Neuroticism: the world is a place of threats


Agreeable: biography characterized by relationships

A person is a Melody of traits.

How to choose a relationship. Better not be too far off in traits.

5% of the vocabulary accounts for 95% of usage. Paretto distribution.

Make a list of 1000 adjectives

Linguistic hypothesis: variation in personality among human beings is of sufficient import that it has become accurately coded on the lexicon.

Construct validation. Does fear exist in the objective world? (Fear is a psychological construct)

Temperament

Political proclivity. 

Liberal: high in openness, low in conscientiousness

Conservative: low in openness, high in conscientiousness

Entrepreneurs are low in conscientiousness, high in openness.

Conscientiousness is a predictor of good performance in graduate School, law, administration, any place where there are rules.

46:10

This is why bureaucracies stultify. All conscientious. No creatives.




====15: Biology/Traits: The Limbic System====

https://youtu.be/AqkFg1pvNDw
This is the 2014 lecture, copied into this 2017 series.

(See also the [[Notes on Jordan Peterson Personality 2015 Limbic System|2015 lecture notes]])

Personality neuroscience.

Gray, Jeffrey, 1995: A model of the limbic system and basal ganglia: applications to anxiety and schizophrenia. A summary of His influential 1982 book. Gray is expert in Behavior, Anatomy, neuropharmacology.

Norbert wiener, MIT: cybernetic Theory

Animal research

LeDoux, Joseph E., 1998: the emotional brain.
Hippocampus compares current situation with desired situation and if they're the same you are calm.

Swanson, L.W., 2000, cerebral hemisphere regulation of motivational Behavior.

Motivation vs emotion

Motivations set goals.

Emotions orient you in relationship to those goals.

Hypothalamus keeps you alive. you can live without your cortex but not without your hypothalamus.

The newly-evolved cortex is in charge only when you're not bothered by anything.

The invisible guerilla video.

The center of the retina is the fovea. Each nerve ending in the retina is connected to 20 cells in the first layer of the cortex. 

The nerve cells in the periphery are good at detecting motion. When you detect motion your eyes swivel to point the fovea at the motion to look at it more clearly.

Only pay attention to things that make you fail. 

Our world is bounded by our expectations and desires. We keep complexity away from us so we don't have to deal with it.

One picture, five ways to see it. Which is correct?

Compression. Thumbnails. Adjust perception to get the level of detail needed to reach our goals.

So where do I goals come from?

Hypothesis: you have to frame the world to interact with it.

ouroboros. Dragon eating its own tail. symbol of Chaos. Chaos is everything outside your safe little world that might intrude and mess things up for you.

We have to frame the world within the chaos. We have to simplify. We have to oversimplify. Frame each problem with only enough complexity needed to complete the task.

Where am i? Head. Heart. stomach.

The nervous system is throughout the body, not just the head.

Blind sight. Some neurons go from the retina direct to the amygdala. Just as some neurons go from the skin to the spine back to the muscles.

Solar plexus.

Some scientists are building robots from the bottom up. You can't have intelligence until you have a body.

1:09:00

Brain.

Left vs right. Stability vs learning.

Cerebellum. More neurons than the rest if the brain. We don't know what it's for. You get wobbly if it's damaged. Affected by alcohol.

Occipital lobe. Vision.

Parietal lobe. Body within in space. Damage the left side and the right side of the body goes paralyzed and the right side of everything disappears.

Temporal lobe. Hearing. Memory.

Frontal lobe. Voluntary movements.

Pre frontal. Potential voluntary movements.

1:15:28 

Brain inside.

Primitive versus old. the old parts of the brain are smart because they've been there a long time. the new parts of the brain are primitive; they don't know what they're doing yet.

Cortex. Some people say it's responsible for conscientiousness.

Thalamus. Collects all sense input, combines, passes back and forth with cortex. (Maybe this back and forth is what consciousness Is. Looping.)

Hippocampus storage of short-term to long-term memory.

Amygdala. Emotional.

Hypothalamus. Primordial motivational states.
====16: Biology/Traits: Incentive Reward/Neuroticism====

https://youtu.be/ewU7Vb9ToXg

Motivation.  

The forefront of:
Brain function.
Emotion.
Personality.
Learning theory. (Aka Behaviorism.)
Behavioral theory.

Motivational system. Usually hypothalamic. 

Motivational state. Sets a goal, and the framework within which goals are pursued. Tunes perception to see only what is relevant. Activates or inhibits Behaviors to pursue the goal. Preps the body to receive the goal. Like a sub-personality.

Emotions track progress toward goals.

Some basic motivations: [circuits?]
  * hunger
  * thirst 
  * pain (and mental equivalents: grief, disappointment, frustration, lonliness)
  * Anger / aggression 
  * thermoregulation
  * Panic / Escape
  * Affiliation / care
  * Sexual desire
  * Exploration 
  * Play 
  * self maintenance: ingestive, defensive
  * Self propagation: reproductive

(Freud would associate these with the ID and consider them primordial.)

pain comes when a signal exceeds a threshold where a component may be damaged.

Psychological pain comes from the cortex. Physical pain comes from the body.

Predatory aggression versus neurotic aggression

Male predatory aggression versus maternal solicitude, opposite ends of the agreeableness distribution

Panic/Escape versus fear, panic is a separate circuit 

Play circuits. Rats laugh. Rough tumble play. (Paanksepp: affective neuroscience)

Swanson: half of the hypothalamus is devoted to exploration.

If all your other needs are met, then you will engage in exploration by default. Extroverts explore in the social space. High in openness explorers in the cognitive space.

Disgust circuit. Separate system. Associated with conscientiousness. Not clear whether this is an emotion or a motivation.

16:14
Hypothalamus. Very complex thing with many sub-components. Half goal framing, half exploration.

22:20
Swanson: motor system has three sets of inputs. 

1. Cognitive. Voluntary. Top-down.

2. State monitoring system. Autonomic.

3. Sensory system. [Reflexes?]

Luria: behavior pattern is a kinetic Melody.

Hierarchical from spine upwards, with different levels of processing.

Body control is part of our intelligence. Olympic feats. [Extreme sports.]

26:00 locomotor pattern generator. In the spine. 

Paraplegic can walk on a treadmill.

Hypothalamic animal acts like an animal, hyperexploratory, sex, defensive aggression. No memory. 

Why hyperexploratory? Brain is not there to dampen the exploration. Also it can't remember what's new or known.

Dual projection system. Eyes connect both to the visual cortex and directly to the motor system. When you see a snake you do not take time to think before you jump.

Historically snakes gave us vision.

40:30 
the whole sensory-motor perception action hierarchy, has to be constructed so that your motivational States stay satiated.

Time frames, social constraints.

43:44

Emotions

Positive: extraversion

Negative: neuroticism

Satiation = consumatory reward = unconditioned response

Approaching the satiation = incentive reward = dopaminergic systems

Approach (behavioral activation)
  * Curiosity 
  * Joy 
  * hope 
  * interest

Defense and avoidance (Fight and behavioral inhibition)
  * Pain 
  * anxiety 
  * disgust

53:05

Units of Positive emotion per promise

Units of negative emotion per threat

Satiation, innate, consumatory rewards serotonin

Incentive rewards, indicate progress towards a consumatory reward, learned or innate, dopamine, exploration circuit or the hypothalamus (excitement, happiness, play, Novelty, enthusiasm)

Extraversion and neuroticism are separate circuits, not mutually exclusive, both can be high

Can be happy and sad simultaneously. Mixed states of positive and negative emotion.

Unconditioned punishments, pain frustration disappointment grief

1:06:20

Hippocampus, amygdala, per sokolov via Norbert wiener

The hippocampus is looking outside at your perception of the world and inside at your memory and expectation. If they match then the hippocampus inhibits the amygdala and the hypothalamus.

Reticular activating circuit, in the brain stem. Turns your brain on to wake you from sleep when you hear a noise that doesn't belong.

When the hippocampus detects an anomaly it disinhibits the reticular activating circuit and the hypothalamus.
====17: Biology and Traits: Agreeableness====

https://youtu.be/G1eHJ9DdoEA

Traits vs emotion.

Agreeable vs disagreeable. 

Agreeable: compassion, politeness.

Women more than men.

Woman's nervous system is wired for mother-child dyad.

Disagreeable: tough-minded, blunt, competitive, won't do anything they don't want to do.

Not defensive aggression, predatory aggression, dominance behavior.

In judging a person, an agreeable person will be compassionate and generous, whereas a Conscientious person will base her judgement solely on performance.

Agreeable person can be exploited. As she is wired to be exploited by an infant.

Do not like conflict. 

Sometimes don't know what they want.

Really disagreeable and really low in conscientiousness is bordering on psychopath.  Add high IQ and high emotional stability and extraversion and he may be charismatic. Will let you do the work and take credit for it. Will have the confidence that is confused with competence.

24:50

Development of aggression in children,  criminality in adults. 

Group children by age 2 through 18. Code Behavior by kicking, biting, fighting and property theft. The group of two-year-olds will contain a subset of aggressive kids, mostly boys. Most of them are socialized by Age 4. Rough and tumble play. Competition. (Ritalin is God awful.) 

If not socialized by age four, their peers reject them. **The job of a parent is to make your kid socially acceptable by the age of 4.**

Criminality in boys occurs between 16 and 24. Same curve for creativity. Testosterone has increased with puberty.

Extreme disagreeableness is predation. Extreme agreeableness is maternal caring. These compete. Opposite ends of the scale.

36:15

Traits and Political persuasion.

Conservative. High in orderliness, low in openness. Puts things in boxes. Borders determinant and inviolable.

Liberal vs conservative. Borders open or closed.

Orderliness is associated with disgust. Conservative. Europeans brought smallpox to Americans.

39:20

Political correctness.

Does it exist?

Methodology.

Collect press quoted. 400

Ask 1000 people to characterize.

Factor analysis. How do they clump? Two groups.

PC liberals were high in openness, high in verbal intelligence, and high in agreeableness.

PC authoritarians were also high in agreeableness. High-end orderliness. Negative correlation with verbal intelligence. Obsessed with language control.

43:25

Temperament allows simplification of the world.

Conscientious: work

Open: discover and do new things

Agreeable: establish intimate relationships

====18: Biology & Traits: Openness/Intelligence/Creativity I====

https://youtu.be/D7Kn5p7TP_Y

Where does intelligence fit into traits?

Big Two: Plasticity vs stability

  stability
    Conscientiousness
      Industrious
      Orderly
    Emotional stability
      Volatility
      Withdrawal
    Agreeableness
      Politeness
      Compassion
    
  Plasticity
    Extroversion
      Assertive
      Enthusiasm
    Openness
      Openness
      Intelligence

Why do they clump?
Stability is serotonin. Plasticity is dopamine.

Big 5 testing is all self-reporting except for intelligence and creativity.

We perceive low resolution representations of the world. And we confuse those with the world. Like South Park.

When unemployment goes up 1%, psychiatric hospitalization goes up 5%.

First problem solved by intelligence. How to perceive the world. Or how to choose a level of abstraction to perceive the world. We abstract the world to an icon and then attach a word to the icon.

Second problem solved by intelligence. How to move from one state to another. How to force the world to manifest in accordance with our wishes.

We also use abstraction to generalize a problem-solving technique and apply it in other situations.

24:35

The traits motivate the perceptual frame.

Extroverts are after social success.

Neurotics are oriented to security and safety.

Agreeable people are oriented to cooperation. Disagreeable people are oriented to competition.

Conscientious people are oriented to order, Duty, obligation, implementation.

Open people are oriented to abstraction.

These are values.

Values are not only what you pursue, but indeed what you perceive.

The traits seem to be higher order agglomerations of the biological motivations.

The hypothalamus regulates the biological motivations including exploration.

Openness and extraversion seem to be manifestations of exploration.

Hippocampus, amygdala, periaqueductal gray related to pain, fear, anxiety which seem to have lower thresholds in neuroticism.

Pain: grief, depression, social isolation, disappointment.

When something threatening occurs how upset should you get? Unknown. That's why there is variability in human responses. Your response is a guess at how bad is the threat. Your guess positions you in the normal distribution curve of neuroticism.

Conscientiousness. How hard should you work? Dependent upon your assumptions about the stability of the future. Conscientiousness only works in a stable Society.

The utility of a trait depends on the surrounding societal environment. That's why there is variability in traits. For the traits no value on the normal distribution curve is any better than any other value.

One exception might be IQ (hi is always better). Except that high IQ is only valuable in a highly complex society. Also high IQ women are more likely to remain single, and therefore perhaps unlikely to reproduce.

33:30

Cognitive ability allows you to do modeling.

the motor cortex models the body and is used to move the body voluntarily.

the premotor cortex evolved out of the motor cortex and is used to Envision potential future actions.

The frontal lobe is used to think about envisioning potential future actions.

Hopper. we developed the ability to abstract so that are stupid ideas can die instead of myself actually dying.

Abstract thinking is creating models of potential future actions in time and space.

And that's also what storytelling is.

A preference for fiction indicates openness. Experiencing simulated worlds.  Reading fiction improves your interpersonal intelligence - the ability to understand the position of the other person.
