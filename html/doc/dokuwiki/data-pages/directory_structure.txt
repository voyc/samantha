How are the linux components organized on disk?

Directories: \\ 
/ - root of the tree \\ 
/bin - binary executable files \\ 
/boot - files used during boot \\ 
/dev - one file for each device, physical and virtual \\ 
/etc - configuration files \\ 
/tmp - temporary files, will be empty at next boot \\ 
/usr - duplicate of whole tree \\ 
/home - one folder for each user \\ 
/root - for the root user, not /home/root \\

sbin - s is for system, for commands that require root privileges
bin - root not required

According to the documentation, /bin and /sbin are for commands that are required before the /usr partition is mounted.  But in Ubuntu 20 on my RacerSwift, they are soft linked to /usr.

The first four - /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin - should be populated only by the package manager.  /usr/local/bin and sbin is for files not coming from the package manager.

Where do executables live?

^ Folder              ^ Who populates   ^ Who uses ^   ^
| /bin                | package manager | any user |   |
| /sbin               | package manager | root     |   |
| /usr/bin            | package manager | any user |   |
| /usr/sbin           | package manager | root     |   |
| /usr/local/bin      | any user        | any user |   |
| /usr/local/sbin     | any user        | root     |   |
| /home/me/.local/bin | me              | me       |   |


Notes:
  * /bin vs /sbin - the s stands for system, used by administrators, require root
  * /bin and /sbin - for exes called early in the boot, before /usr is mounted
  * /usr/bin and /usr/sbin - for exes called after /usr is mounted
  * /usr/local - overrides will not be tampered with during package manager update

Special cases
  * /lib
  * /etc/init.d - startup scripts, services
  * Libraries are also executable?
  * What are bin, lib, share?

Where do configuration files live?
  * /etc
