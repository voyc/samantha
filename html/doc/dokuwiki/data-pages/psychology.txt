  * 1950: Maslow: [[Heirarchy of Needs]] : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s//hierarchy_of//needs\\
  * 1958 Berne: [[Transactional Analysis]].  Every interaction between humans is in fact a transaction, where goods and services pass between the parties.\\
  * 1960: Marshall Rosenberg: [[Nonviolent Communication]] (NVC).  Lists of feelings and needs, and the recommendation that accurately communicating feelings and needs can results in greater happiness and harmony.  http://hagstrand.com/nvc/
  * 1994: Richard Hawkins: [[Map of Consciousness]] a list of feeling states on logarithmic scale from 0 to 1000. http://lab.hagstrand.com/consciousness_levels/hawkins.html
  * 1998: Hal Stone: Voice Dialog.  The psyche is made up of multiple selves.  Voice Dialog is a therapeutic technique of identifying the selves and communicating with each one.

The human is a programmed device.

Is there some kind of thinking that is not programmed?

Convergent\\
Divergent\\
In the 1950s, the psychologist J. P. Guilford divided creative thought into two categories: convergent thinking and divergent thinking. Convergent thinking, which Guilford defined as the ability to answer questions correctly, is predominantly a display of memory and logic. Divergent thinking, the ability to generate many potential answers from a single problem or question, shows a flair for curiosity, an ability to think “outside the box.” It’s the difference between remembering the capital of Austria and figuring how to start a thriving business in Vienna without knowing a lick of German.

==== Transactional Analysis ====

also differs from Freudian analysis in explaining that an individual's final emotional state is the result of inner dialogue between different parts of the psyche, as opposed to the Freudian hypothesis that imagery is the overriding determinant of inner emotional state. (For example, depression may be due to ongoing critical verbal messages from the inner Parent to the inner Child.) Berne believed that it is relatively easy to identify these inner dialogues and that the ability to do so is parentally suppressed in early childhood.[6]\\

Revising Freud's concept of the human psyche as composed of the id, ego, and super-ego, Berne postulated in addition three "ego states"—the Parent, Adult, and Child states—which were largely shaped through childhood experiences. These three are all part of Freud's ego; none represent the id or the superego.\\

Berne presented his theories in two popular books on transactional analysis: Games People Play (1964) and What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1975). I'm OK, You're OK (1969), written by Berne's long-time friend Thomas Anthony Harris, is probably the most popular TA book.\\
