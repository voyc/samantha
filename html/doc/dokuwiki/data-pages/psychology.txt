Who am I?\\
The unexamined life.\\

==== Psychological Models ====
The following models of personality have been put forward.

  * 700 BCE: Patanjali [[Yoga]]\\
  * 700 BCE: Buddha  [[Buddhist Psychology]]\\
  * 1885: Sigmund Freud.  ego, id, super-ego; libido, death drive, neurotic guilt, psychoanalysis\\
  * 1912: Carl Jung.  Individuation. synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion. The persona vs the shadow, the conscious part we present to others vs the unconscious aggressive and lustful part we cannot accept. \\
  * 1950: Maslow: [[Heirarchy of Needs]] : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s//hierarchy_of//needs\\
  * 1958 Berne: [[Transactional Analysis]].  Every interaction between humans is in fact a transaction, where goods and services pass between the parties.\\
  * 1960: Marshall Rosenberg: [[Nonviolent Communication]] (NVC).  Lists of feelings and needs, and the recommendation that accurately communicating feelings and needs can results in greater happiness and harmony.  http://hagstrand.com/nvc/
  * 1994: Richard Hawkins: [[Map of Consciousness]] a list of feeling states on logarithmic scale from 0 to 1000. http://lab.hagstrand.com/consciousness_levels/hawkins.html
  * 1998: Hal Stone: Voice Dialog.  The psyche is made up of multiple selves.  Voice Dialog is a therapeutic technique of identifying the selves and communicating with each one.

The human is a programmed device.

==== Models with Tests ====
Psychometric testing expresses an individual's personality as a list of traits and a numeric value for each trait.

==== Motivation ====
Pleasure and Pain\\
Desire and Fear\\
Fear of death. Hal\\
Maslow’s Hierarchy, meeting needs, an unmet need is a pain.\\
When a need falls below zero pain increases, the organism is increasingly desperate to fill the need, more focus and energy spent, morality parameters overridden, willing to experience pain in other areas, to get the need met.  Sacrifice.
Tension release\\
Completion\\
Satisfaction of desire\\
Vanquishing the for\\
\\
Numeric value of a state\\
Increasing attention to out of balance states\\
Mania\\


Motivation and polarity
How are pain and pleasure implemented in the body-mind?
Pain vs pleasure
Fear of pain
Desire for pleasure

Emotion resolves to fear and desire which are attraction and repulsion which are polarity negative and positive.

Every memory has emotion attached to it which means every memory has polarity.

==== Desire ====

==== Thinking ====
Categorical\\
Deductive\\
Inductive\\
Dialectic\\
Scientific method: hypothesis, test

model, prediction, prescription\\
classification, prediction, optimization\\

human intel vs artifical intel\\
thinking plus knowledge (memory)\\
model building\\
models include numeric values and judgements\\

Is there some kind of thinking that is not programmed?

Convergent\\
Divergent\\
In the 1950s, the psychologist J. P. Guilford divided creative thought into two categories: convergent thinking and divergent thinking. Convergent thinking, which Guilford defined as the ability to answer questions correctly, is predominantly a display of memory and logic. Divergent thinking, the ability to generate many potential answers from a single problem or question, shows a flair for curiosity, an ability to think “outside the box.” It’s the difference between remembering the capital of Austria and figuring how to start a thriving business in Vienna without knowing a lick of German.

Nisargadatta: Understand the root cause of your fears -- estrangement from yourself; and of desires -- the longing for the self, and your karma will dissolve like a dream.

==== Transactional Analysis ====

also differs from Freudian analysis in explaining that an individual's final emotional state is the result of inner dialogue between different parts of the psyche, as opposed to the Freudian hypothesis that imagery is the overriding determinant of inner emotional state. (For example, depression may be due to ongoing critical verbal messages from the inner Parent to the inner Child.) Berne believed that it is relatively easy to identify these inner dialogues and that the ability to do so is parentally suppressed in early childhood.[6]\\

Revising Freud's concept of the human psyche as composed of the id, ego, and super-ego, Berne postulated in addition three "ego states"—the Parent, Adult, and Child states—which were largely shaped through childhood experiences. These three are all part of Freud's ego; none represent the id or the superego.\\

Berne presented his theories in two popular books on transactional analysis: Games People Play (1964) and What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1975). I'm OK, You're OK (1969), written by Berne's long-time friend Thomas Anthony Harris, is probably the most popular TA book.\\

==== Mental Illness ====

The mentally disturbed do not employ the Principle of Scientific Parsimony: the most simple theory to explain a given set of facts. They shoot for the baroque.\\

==== Theory of mind ====

Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states — beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc. — to oneself, and to others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.[1] Theory of mind is crucial for everyday human social interactions and is used when analyzing, judging, and inferring others' behaviors.[2] Deficits can occur in people with autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,[3] cocaine addiction,[4] and brain damage suffered from alcohol's neurotoxicity.[5] Although philosophical approaches to this exist, the theory of mind as such is distinct from the philosophy of mind.
