Spinal reflexes
Hypothalamus (Spinal column and hypothalamus alone the cat acts like a cat, including exploratory)

Autonomous nervous system
Voluntary motor system
Sensory system

Piagettian proposition
Id = motivation
Gray and Swanson

Play circuit. Discovered by Jaaak Panksepp.

Primary circuits 

Circuits = personalities = subsystems = primary sub-personalities = neural architectures

  * Play
  * Exploration
  * Defensive aggression
  * Sexual behavior
  * Temperature regulation
  * Food and water intake
  * Excretion
  * Breathing
  * Pain
  * Anxiety
  * Sensual circuits: visual, auditory, olfactory, taste,
  * Parietal: how your body is positioned in space
  * Abstract construction of models
  * Language
  * Empathy: maternal behavior
  * Hunting: predatory behavior
  * Dominance and subordination
  * Creativity
  * Social activity (related to exploratory)

The location of higher functions are not fixed in location prior to developmdnt. Cortical levels of the brain can be inhabited by the lower levels of the brain.  If you remove the left hemisphere of an infant, the circuits will develop in the right. The visual circuit would prefer to use the visual cortex but if the visual cortex has been removed it will colonize the auditory cortex area instead.

There is more space inside your head then there is outside your head.  Defining space as the number of ways that something can be configured.

We do not understand consciousness.
Consciousness may seem to be an emergent late evolutionary  function. But it doesn't really look like that.

Difference between awake and conscious.

Sensory strip, motor strip, adjacent to prefrontal cortex.

The prefrontal cortex grew out of the motor cortex. This implies that thought is abstracted action.  Throwing off avatars which perish instead of me.

34:30
Russian psychologists\\
Pavlov\\
Luria\\
Sokolov, discovered the orienting response.\\
Gray: theory of anxiety and incentive motivation.

Luria was also influenced by Piaget and Norbert wiener.

Norbert Weiner, MIT, cybernetic models of embodied cognition. These models were used by Gray in his theories of anxiety.

[Wikipedia. Jean Piaget:  Swiss psychologist and epistemologist known for his pioneering work in child 8development. Piaget's theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called "genetic epistemology".]

36:08
Luria. Motor versus sensory.

Auditory and visual circuits are cortical. Smell and taste are way old and reside in more central parts of the brain.

Motor vs sensory, front vs back. Prefrontal cortex and motor strip in the front. sensory areas (auditory and visual) in the back.

Left vs right

Conventional: left is linguistic, right is non-linguistic.

Preferred: Luria: right is for initial stages of novelty detection, left adjust the status quo to incorporate the novelties.

38:29
Integration of Swanson's model and Gray's model and the orienting reflex models of sokolov.

1960s, Russians started studying lower brain function with EEG.

Sokolov was also using skin conductance response. (That's what scientologists to use.) Sweaty skin conducts electricity more efficiently. The presence of sweat means the body is preparing to act.

Habituation. Orienting response. The hippocampus makes a map of the world. When a stimulus does not match the map the orienting response is triggered.

Aside. Important discoveries in psychology. Sokolov and Vinogradova discovered the orienting response. Olds and Milner discovered incentive reward system, the circuit for positive emotion and exploration in 1970s. Panksepp discovered the play circuit. 

Aside. Skinner's rats were starved to 75% of their body weight. Were also lonesome and isolated.

Behaviorism: Stimulus-response.
Cognition: Expectancy maps.  Respond by acting to match the map.

Story of rat running a maze to get food.

Norbert Weiner, guiding missiles. Aim, then correct like a thermostat.

Hypothalamus, sugar in the blood. Thermostat to keep the level within bounds.

Hunger. Taste good or bad, eat or stop eating. 

Seven tastes. Good or bad taste calculated separately for each.

Bulemia, war between subsystems.

1:06:47 Consumatory reward vs Incentive reward.

Consumatory reward. #circuit
Satiation. Not much of a reward. It shuts off the system that was demanding that consumption.

Incentive reward. #circuit

Domaminergic system. As you approach your goal, the dopamine gives you a positive emotion.

Expectation. Cognition.

Desire.

Motivation comes from desire, not just matching expectation.

Absence of a desired entity is a stimulus. It produces an orienting response, makes you frustrated and aggressive. A negative feeling. A punishment.

Fear is the expectation that a punishment might occur.

Punishment, pain. #circuit\\
Threat of punishment, anxiety (fear). #circuit

Novelty, gap between expected and reality.

Rule. Make the minimum change necessary to solve the problem.

How to calculate the degree of our reaction to a novelty.

As we progress to a goal three things can happen.

1. Things are going well.

2. Small obstruction which can be fixed easily.

3. Hit an anomaly.

The positive emotion when things are going well is produced by the incentive reward system, and is the same emotion that is experienced by extroverts.

Incentive reward system quite active in extroverts. Not active in introverts.

Person with neuroticism tends to react with more pain to the same amount of disruption.
