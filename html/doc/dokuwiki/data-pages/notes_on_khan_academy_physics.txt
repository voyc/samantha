Isaac Newton\\
Max Planck\\
Albert Einstein

Vector has magnitude and direction\\
Scalar has magnitude only

Distance is a scalar\\
Displacement is a vector

Speed is a scalar\\
Velocity is a vector

Frame of reference
3 points of view: ground, car, airplane

Velocity = displacement / time\\
v = s / t\\
v = 5 km north / 1 hr = 5 km/hr north


Rate of speed = distance / time\\
r = d / t

Vector symbols are bold and have an arrow above.

Instantaneous versus average\\
Position versus time graphs\\

Acceleration = change in velocity over time\\
Displacement per second per second

Velocity-time line\\
Distance is the area under the line

Acceleration-time line\\
Rise over run\\
The area under the line gives the change in velocity

The change in acceleration over time is the jerk.

==Kinematic formulas and projectile motion==

$Î”x$ = Displacement\\
$t$ = Time interval\\
$v$ = Initial velocity\\
$v$ = Final velocity\\
$a$ = Constant acceleration\\
