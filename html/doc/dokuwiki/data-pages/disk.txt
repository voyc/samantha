====== Disk, Partition, File System ======
$ mount # with no parameters, list mounted filesystems


$ sudo fdisk -l # list partitions


Note: In addition to listing disks and partitions, fdisk also lists loop mounts. A loop mount looks like a disk but is in fact a file containing a file system, created by a snap package install.
$ df -T  # disk filesystem format type


$ du -hs   # disk used total
$ du -hs *  # disk used per folder
$ du -a /dir/ | sort -n -r | head -n 20 # find largest files
tar
$ tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file
$ tar -xvzf name-of-archive.tar.gz
fdisk
Used to create partitions on a disk.
mount 
Use the mount command to attach (mount) file systems and removable devices such as USB flash drives at a particular mount point in the directory tree.


Note device_name vs mount point.  Both exist in the directory tree.  Mount point is a directory.


$ mount # with no parameters, list mounted filesystems in format as follows
device_name on directory type filesystem_type (options)
/dev/sda1 on /media/john/Seagate Expansion Drive type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096,uhelper=udisks2)


$ mount [OPTION...] DEVICE_NAME DIRECTORY
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media
$ unmount device_name
$ unmount mount_point


When I plug in my seagate and usb stick drives, the OS automatically mounts them as follows.


/dev/sda1 on /media/john/Seagate Expansion Drive
/dev/sdb1 on /media/john/USB20FD

Mount and soft link have similar parameters.
A disk drive must be mounted once and only once, before you can do an ls.
A soft link may be done any number of times on any folder or file, but not on a device_name.
