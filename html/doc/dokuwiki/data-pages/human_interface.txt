====== GUI ======


===== 3 layers =====

1. **X windows**.  aka X11 or X.  Underlying technology for bitmapped display.  Part of the kernel.  Open source.  Originated at MIT in 1984, the same year the Mac appeared.  X uses a clientâ€“server model.  An X server accepts client requests for graphical output (windows) and sends back user input (from keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen).

2. **Window manager**.  Requires X windows.  Puts the window decoration around the contents including the buttons to minimize or close. It allows resizing and moving the windows around, and decides which window is on top.



*   Enlightenment
*   Gala
*   Mutter
*   kwinx
*   i3
*   Joe's Window Manager (JWM)
*   Window Maker
*   IceWM
*   Afterstep
*   FVWW
*   Fluxbox
*   TWM
*   Megacity
*   Compiz

3. **Desktop environment**.  Requires a window manager.  Gives you an overall user experience. It has the panels, the system menus, the starters, the status applets. It might offer a default file explorer and viewer. It might contain a default editor, terminal program, and emailer, all made to look alike and work together.



*   Gnome - GNU Network Object Model Environment
*   KDE -  K Desktop Environment, now renamed Plasma
*   Pantheon
*   MATE - a fork of Gnome 2
*   Cinnamon
*   Ubuntu Budgie
*   Xfce

Gnome 2 used Metacity, which has been abandoned in favor of Mutter

Gnome 3 uses Mutter, which began as a fork of Metacity

Gnome 3 Shell is a Metacity plugin

Not everyone is happy with Gnome 3, because it lost many good features of Gnome 2.

Linus Torvalds used Gnome 2, then Xfce, then KDE, and as of 2013 back to Gnome 3 with extensions, particularly [Frippery](https://github.com/wangyr/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/master/Bottom_Panel@rmy.pobox.com/gnome-shell-frippery), and the [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://launchpad.net/gnome-tweak-tool).

Ubuntu uses Gnome 3 by default.

Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE

Neon is also Ubuntu with KDE
