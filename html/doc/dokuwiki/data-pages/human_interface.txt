====== The Human Interface ======

===== from teletype to chat =====

type at a distance

===== Command Line Interface (CLI) =====

1874 typewriter = keyboard plus printer.

1922 tele-typewriter = A typewriter operating at a distance.

A global teletype network, Telex, established in the 1920s.
Still used today in shipping, news, weather and military communications.

teletype = tty = abbreviations for tele-typewriter.

The first typewriter printed on single sheets of paper.

Teletype machines and the first printers used a continuous spool of paper.

Modern printers have gone back to single sheets.

1960s - first VDU's  Visual Display Unit.  Glass TTY's.  

console - a teletype used to interact with a computer

terminal - same thing as a console.

shell - 

prompt

chat

webchat

telnet

ssh

Console, Headless.

Picture a server farm with thousands of rack-mounted servers running 24/7 for years on end.

An operator can use ssh to connect to any individual server to monitor and maintain.

Console

Shell

  * sh, Bourne shell, Steve Bourne
  * sh, POSIX shell
  * bash, Bourne Again Shell
  * ksh, Korn shell, 
  * zsh
  * csh, C shell
  * tcsh

Terminal window. Aka terminal emulator or terminal program. A console within a window. Requires a window manager.

  * gnome-terminal
  * konsole
  * xterm
  * rxvt
  * kvt
  * nxterm
  * eterm


===== Graphical User Interface (GUI) =====

==== 3 layers ====

1. **X windows**.  aka X11 or X.  Underlying technology for bitmapped display.  Part of the kernel.  Open source.  Originated at MIT in 1984, the same year the Mac appeared.  X uses a client–server model.  An X server accepts client requests for graphical output (windows) and sends back user input (from keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen).

2. **Window manager**.  Requires X windows.  Puts the window decoration around the contents including the buttons to minimize or close. It allows resizing and moving the windows around, and decides which window is on top.

  * Enlightenment
  * Gala
  * Mutter
  * kwinx
  * i3
  * Joe's Window Manager (JWM)
  * Window Maker
  * IceWM
  * Afterstep
  * FVWW
  * Fluxbox
  * TWM
  * Megacity
  * Compiz

3. **Desktop environment**.  Requires a window manager.  Gives you an overall user experience. It has the panels, the system menus, the starters, the status applets. It might offer a default file explorer and viewer. It might contain a default editor, terminal program, and emailer, all made to look alike and work together.

  * Gnome - GNU Network Object Model Environment
  * KDE -  K Desktop Environment, now renamed Plasma
  * Pantheon
  * MATE - a fork of Gnome 2
  * Cinnamon
  * Ubuntu Budgie
  * Xfce

Gnome 2 used Metacity, which has been abandoned in favor of Mutter

Gnome 3 uses Mutter, which began as a fork of Metacity

Gnome 3 Shell is a Metacity plugin

Not everyone is happy with Gnome 3, because it lost many good features of Gnome 2.

Linus Torvalds used Gnome 2, then Xfce, then KDE, and as of 2013 back to Gnome 3 with extensions, particularly [Frippery](https://github.com/wangyr/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/master/Bottom_Panel@rmy.pobox.com/gnome-shell-frippery), and the [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://launchpad.net/gnome-tweak-tool).

Ubuntu uses Gnome 3 by default.

Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE

Neon is also Ubuntu with KDE
