1903 Ernest Rutherford began to speak of the possibility of atomic energy.

1911 Geiger-Marsden gold foil experiments.

1913 Ernest Rutherford described the nucleus to explain the gold foil experiments.

Electromagnetic radiation is absorbed or emitted as electrons move out or in among the shells respectively. Electrons in the higher shells have a higher energy level than those in the inner shells.

A radioactive element has an unstable nucleus. the unstable nucleus will Decay by emitting particles until it becomes stable.

Four types of nuclear radiation, defined by the type of particle emitted from the nucleus.

  * Alpha particle, same structure as a helium nucleus.
  * Beta particle, Electron, formed when a neutron splits into a proton and an electron
  * Gamma rays, a type of electromagnetic radiation
  * Neutron

==== Coffee ====

grind: course, medium, fine
filter coffee: one coffee bean yields 100 particles
espresso: 3,000 particles
Turkish coffee: 45,000 particles

Turkish coffee world

Turkish coffee.
On medium heat until just before it starts to boil. 
Should take 7 to 10 minutes.

Turkish coffee has stronger flavor and less caffeine than espresso.
Turkish coffee uses Arabica beans, medium to dark roast, extra fine grind.

How is Turkish coffee different from regular coffee?
The difference between Turkish coffee and regular coffee is the grind size and brewing method. Firstly, grounds used in Turkish coffee are extra fine (finer than espresso) and are brewed in a special pot called cezve. Secondly, the brewing process involves a so-called first rise and second rise - even a third rise according to pro Turkish coffee brewers - producing a thick, intensely flavoured cup of coffee topped with perfect foam.

Drink at 65°C
Average Body 37°C

80°C (my new thermometer aimed at boiling water)

Aero press
15g coffee
250g water
16:1
Temperature: 
Brew time: 1.5 mikes
Grind: fine sand

Bean is 70% cellulose, 30% solubles
Cellulose gives bean it's structure and solidity but is not water-soluble
Solubles give color, flavor, aroma
Strong vs weak: water coffee ratio
Under-developed vs bitter: brew time

==copper, stainless steel, tin, aluminum==

“Copper is king here: It has nearly twice the thermal conductivity of aluminum… is five times more conductive than cast iron and 25 times more than stainless steel. Serious cooks love copper for this quality.” The first thing you'll notice when using tin-lined copper cookware is how fast it heats up.
Q:
I have some heavy pans in which the tin lining has worn away and the copper is showing through. Should I have them re-lined? Where can I have this done, and how much might it cost? Is it unhealthy to cook with the copper exposed?

Grace Low, Eugene, OR

A:
Copper is unbeatable for cooking because it conducts heat so evenly. Tin-lined pans are wonderful, but the lining may be harmed by temperatures higher than 405 degrees F, or by long use. You should have your pans retinned because exposed copper can be toxic.

The cost of retinning is about half the cost of a new pan. Any silversmith should be able to provide this service. Look in the Yellow Pages, or call the best cookware store in your area and see whom they recommend. In the future, you could buy stainless-steel-lined copper pans, which cost about twice as much, but don’t wear out like tin-lined pans do.
