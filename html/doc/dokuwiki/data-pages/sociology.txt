====== Sociology ======

Human nature expresses similarly in the organism and the group.

Humans organize themselves in two patterns.  
  - two halves
  - a pyramid

Bifurcation, branching: blood vessels, snowflake, dendrites. Split repeatedly into heirarchy, growth.

(Fractal)

Team, split, halve, natural selection

Pyramid, hierarchy

at what level did Warren Buffett identify with when he screwed Neveda homeowners?
nestle, water theft
oil companies fracking
armaments companies
news personalities

Even if we identify with all humanity, there are alternative ways to make decisions.
  - humanist - cares about suffering, individuals, 
  - natural selection - cares more about the strength of humanity as a species and is willing to sacrifice individuals to make a stronger species

This same distinction is made at every level.  Racism and nationalism, for example.

Collective Consciousness \\
Collective Behavior \\
Autonomous vehicles and drones cooperate \\
Collective improvisation: musicians, actors, comedians

Group Psychology\\
Group behavior is an expansion of individual behavior.\\ 
Group dynamics \\
Social Psychology \\
Society \\

Personalities fit together like lock and key proteins.

==== Equality Model ====

Egalitarian

"Well, our aim here at Matrix Masters is to provoke an unmuffled, ungagged, and unsilenced generation of world citizens into speaking up and taking the actions necessary to wrest control from the privileged few and to reclaim this planet in the name of all the humans, animals, plants, and other forms of life who share its bounty."

In stark contrast to the Hierarchy Model.  Male dominance.

Which is real?  Why so many believe in Equality while the Hierarchy appears to be "built-in".

Relative poverty causes crime. Unequal wealth distribution. Men want to climb the dominance hierarchy for access to women. Gini coefficient to aggression, high correlation, like .8.

Power: military, population, business, religion

The four estates: govt, religion, business, media, technology

Population is the only power that matters.

American foreign policy, good for middle east, bad for America.

Over-fishing
Newport, cannery row
Amed, outrigger canoes beached

See Lanka, boat got a strike, next day every boat cane to throw it's nets down and try the same spot

Eat at McDonald's
Drink soft drink
Fruit juice sweetened with corn syrup
Pizza, spaghetti, white flour, nonutritional value but a glycemic effect worse than that of sugar and fills your arteries with sludge
Leading to diabetes and heart disease
