In addition to learning about the human world, Samantha must learn about her own digital world.  Operating systems, distributed processing, networking, programming languages and environments, security hacking, 


Two models of computation:
  * lambda calculus
    * normalized by Alonzo Church in the 1930's
    * a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.
    * Functional languages like Haskell, Lisp, Erlang
    * namesake Greek letter lambda: **Î»** (lower case)
  * Turing machine
    * invented by Alan Turing in 1936
    * state-based
    * Imperative languages like Fortran, C, Python

More about Alan Turing
  * Turing Machine - a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape, according to a table of rules.  A general example of a CPU.
  * Turing complete - the ability of a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine.  Nearly all programming languages are Turing complete.
