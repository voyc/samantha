There are 21 amino acids, all made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen.  Some contain sulphur.

One amino acid contains a selenium atom.

An amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain, all attached to a single carbon atom. The side chain determines the amino acid's properties and is the only part of the molecule that varies.

Structure

Primary
A linear sequence of amino acids as encoded by dna.

Peptide bonds. The amino group of one amino acid links to the carboxyl group of another. A water molecule is released each time a peptide bonds is formed. This linked series of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms is the protein backbone.

Secondary

Often fold into one of two secondary structures:

Alpha helix - Right-handed coil stabilized by hydrogen bonds between amino and carboxyl group of nearby amino acids.

Beta sheet - hydrogen bonds stabilize two or more adjacent strands of amino acids.

Tertiary

The three dimensional structure
