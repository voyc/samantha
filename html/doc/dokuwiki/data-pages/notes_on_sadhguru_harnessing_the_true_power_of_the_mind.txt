======Notes on Sadhguru Harnessing the True Power of the Mind======

There are 16 dimensions to the mind, falling into four categories: buddhi, manas, ahankara, and chitta. 

  - buddhi is intellect 
  - manas is memory 
  - ahankara is identity 
  - chitta is intelligence without memory

==Buddhi, Intellect==

Buddhi is the intellect, the logical dimension of thought. 

==Manas, Memory==

==Ahankara, Identity==

==Chitta, Pure Intelligence==

Chitta is unsullied by memory.  Pure intelligence, cosmic intelligence.

Chitta is the last point of the mind. It connects to the basis of creation within you. It connects you with your consciousness.
